leaders from UCSD and San

AS. President JeM Pae began 
the protest with UCSD and

A.S. council passes 
. 2004-05 budget 

Plan includes a 24-percent 
cut to college councils 
By USAMAK 

Senior Staff Ykiter 

The Associated Students 
approved the executive budget for 
the 2004-05 year by a 16-4-4 vote 
at their June 2 meeting. In light of 
lower-than-expected revenues, 
the new budget cut an average of 
10 percent across the board for all 
funding allocations. 

"It's a maintenance year, not a 
growth year," Thurgood Marshall 
College Junior Senator Kate Pillon 
said. 

College councils took over a 24-
percent cut in their funding, from 
$65,700 this year to a proposed 
S50,25f1 for nen year. 

"1 !!Unk it's ridiculous that in a 
year [colleges] are elperiencing 
[such a large] cut," Thurgood 
Marshall Senior Senator Kate 
Maull said. 

According to Warren College 
Chair Erik Ward, the cuts to col-
lege budgets will affect the opera-
tions of college-affiliated organiza-
tions. 

"The main effect is that A. 
won't be able to provide as much 
funding for events and organiza-
tions," Ward said. 

A major point of contention 
during dicussions of the budget 
centered on funding allocated for 
student-initiated outreach pro-
gramming and operating costs . 
Outreach was one of the few areas 
that received an increase in fund-
ing for next year, partially to make 
up for the state cuts that the out-
reach programs have also experi-
enced. 

Although A.S. president Jenn 
Pae originally proposed allocating 
$52 ,000 to outreach, the council 
amended the figure to $41,000 in 
the final budget . 

Several A.S. councilmembers 
were opposed to the original figure 
for the funding. 

"I think it's a really bad prece-
dent for A.S. to be [outreach's] sale 
source of funding after the state 
cuts," John Muir College

Assembly approves use of

Staff Writer 

The state Assembly voted on 
May 26 to allow UC and CSU cam-
puses to consider nce as a factor in 
the admissions process, a move crit-
icized by opponents of affirmative 
action. 

Passed 45-30 by the state 
Assembly without any debate, AB 
2387 will allow the UC and CSU 
systems to consider race, ethnicity, 
national origin, gender, geography 
and income, along with other rele-
vant factors established by the sys-
tems' admission boards, during the 
admissions process. 

"The purpose of the bill is to 

give the admissions office a tool 
they can utilize so they can review 
the applicant's letter holistically, 
where everything is taken into 
consideration, not just that per-
son's score and GPA," said Ricardo 
Lara, director of communications 
for Assemblyman Marco 
Firebaugh (D-South Gate), who 
introduced the bill. "We believe 
that where the person comes from, 
their race and ethnicity all playa 
role as a precursor of the student's . 
talent."

has not taken a position on the bill,

As graduating seniors prepare 
for life after colJege, financial 
indicators suggest that they wiJl be 
entering an economy that has 
improved over the past three 
years. 

"We are seeing an improve-
ment in the job market," said 
Andy Ceperiey, director of the 
Career Services Center. "Looking 
at the job postings [on Port 
Triton), we are starting to see 
month-to-month increases." 

Cnig Schmidt, assistant direc-
tor of the Career Services Center, 
added that there are more intern-
ships, part-time and especially 
full-time listings on Port Triton 
now than there were one year 
ago. 

"This is a good sign that the 
economy is picking up," Schmidt 
said. "There is also an increase in 
companies participating in the job 
fairs. It is not a dramatic increase, 
but after the past three years, this 
is good."

omy, fewer employers came to

Diredors appointed to 

oversee research 
The California Institute for 

Telecommunications and Information 
Technology has announced the appointment 
of two associate directors to coordinate and 
expand the institute's role in homeland securi-
tt and medical informatics research at UCSD. 

Both positions will be filled by current tac-
ultt members. 

Scripps Institution of Oceanography Deputt 
Director William Hodgkiss will take over the 
responsibilitt for all homeland secuntt-related 
research activities. He is also an adjunct pro-
fessor at Jacobs School of Engineering. 

School of Medicine professor Leshe Lenert 
will oversee exploration in the emerging field 
of medical informatics - an area combining 
elements of medical science, wireless commu· 
nications and information technology. 

More freshmen plan to 
attend than expeded 

Almost 8 percent more incoming freshmen 
submitted their Statements of Intent to 
Register than the statistical models used by 
UCSD administrators had anticipated. 

Even after the "summer mel~' when the 
number of incoming students is expected to 
fall from 4,100 to 3,900, the amount will still 
be 100 students higher than the estimated lev-
els, according to Mae Brown, assistant vice 
chancellor of admissions and enrollment ser-
vices. 

The university expected that higher tuition 
and fees would cause more students to go 
elsewhere, Brown said. 

The numbers are a positive indicator of the 
student interest in the campus, she said. 

Admissions personnel plan to work closely 
with housing officials and the Academic Senate 
to accommodate the greater number of stu-
dents.

Study lays basis for university expansion 
New hotel, performing arts center considered 

By VLADIMIR KOGAN 
Senior Staff Writer 

A preliminary May report on 
the expansion of University 
Center and Sixth College has ree-
ornmended the flattening of Camp 
Snoopy housing and partial filling 
of Pepper Canyon for the creation 
of a new light-rail transit system. 

Currently available for public 
input, the University Center and 
Sixth College Neighborhood ' 
Planning Study will serve as the 
primary blueprint for develop-
ment forecasted to last through 
2038 in response to a growing stu-
dent population, according to its 
authors. 

"I think this whole redevelop-
ment has the potential to become 
something that [ feel many stu-
dents, many faculty and many staff 
are hungry for: a sense that there is 
a center [to the university), that 

there is reaUy stuff going on," said 
Sixth College Provost Gabriele 
Wienhausen, who worked with 
other campus officials, consultants 
and student representatives on the 
committee that drafted the report. 

The plan proposes the creation 
of a permanent home for Sixth 
College through construction near 
the current Matthews and Pepper 
Canyon apartments. Camp 
Snoopy residence halls would be 
demolished and replaced with new 
structures and an open quad. 

"The idea of this plan is to 
maKe [Sixth College] whole," said 
Lance B. Schulte, the manager for 
the project and a senior planner in 
Physical Planning. 

An amphitheater and a per-
forming artS center would also be 
built near the college. 

In addition, the administrative 
complex located next to Center 
Hall would be replaced with new 

open areas for pedestrian traffic 
under the proposal, including a 
"Town Square" and a separate 
courtyard. The locale would come 
complete with utility hookups, 
serving as a venue for events lilc.e 
job fairs or fartner's markets and 
available for reservation by cam-
pus organizations, according to 
Director of Physical Planning 
Susan Peerson. 

"The intent is mat we stan to 
bring in night and weekend uses 
(of the area]," Peerson said. 
"That's a very important element 
of the plan." 

To make the new center "the 
heart of campus social and acade-
mic life," Peerson and Schulte said 
the buildings in the area would 
include pedestrian-&iendly arcade 
walkways on the ground level,

More black applicants 
moving to : Southem states 

., ....... IIUN 
Doily Btuin 

(U. california-Los AftaeIes) 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -

Problems the University of 
California has h.d in enrolling 
black students may be aggravated 
by a "reverse migration" trend that 
is drawing many black families out 
of places such as California and 
bringing them to the South. 

A recent study undertaken by 
the Brookings Institute found that 
an increased number of black pro-
fessionals Ire moving away from 
the West, North and East into 
Southern states. 

Brookings researchers have 
called this move a "reverse migra-
tion" because in the early 20th cen-
tury many black families decided to 
move out of the South and settle in 
other areas, a trend known as the 
Great Migration. 

"The South is really being 
viewed by many as a kind of a new 
Mecca, a land of opportunity," said 
Charles Christian, professor of 
urban and social population geog-
raphy at the University of 
Maryland, CoUege Park. "[Blacks) 
see the South as a place where their 
children can grow up in safer com-
munities and attend better 
schools." 

This emphasis on Southern 
schools makes some scholars 
express concern over the projected 
decline in the number of black stu-
dents in colleges and universi ties in 
states such as California. 

The number of black students 
in many public universities around 
the country, including the 
University of California, is already 
considered. al~ngly low, they 
say. 

According to a study conducted 
last month by the UCLA Ralph j. 
Bunche Center for Aftican-
American Studies, the number of 
black fteshmen admitted to UCLA 
has been declining. 

The study found that UCLA 

admitted 470 io-state black fresh-
men in 1997, but by fall 2004, the 
number of admissions declined by 
58 percent to 199 admits. 

Systemwide figures shoW a 
slighdy more positive trend, with 
enrollment for black students 
increasing by 5 percent in 2003. 

But this increase translates to a 
little above 4,500 students, a rela-
tively low number when com-
pared to the over 159,000 under-
graduates who attend the 
University of California and the 
over 2 million black residents in 
California. 

This low number of black stu-
dents may continue to decline par-
tially due to reverse migration. 

"A lot of state universities 
recruit students from inside the 
state, which would mean less stu-
dents if some of them move away," 
said William Fry, author of the 
Brookings Institute study and a fel-
low at the institute. 

Former UCLA professor Jim 
Johnson, an expert on reverse 
migration, counts himself as part of 
the reverse migution trend. 

He moved to North Carolina 
from California a few years ago to 
take care of his grandmother. 

Johnson, who is currently a 
business professor at the University 
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 
said the quality of public education 
in non-Southern states plays a big 
role in the decision of many blacks 
to move. 

"As the public school system 
deteriorates, people will begin (0 
move with their feet," Johnson 
said. 

A combination of factors, 
including the perceived deteriora-
tion of public education in non-
Southern states, the tendency of 
students to attend educational insti-
tutions close to their home and the 
increasing appeal of traditionally 
black universities in the South may 
lead to fewer black students attend-

Rally: Speakers promote higher education South: Region gaining in

Chancellor Charles B. Reed, 
undergraduate fees would increase 
by 14 percent in 2004-05 and 
another 8 percent in 2005-06 and 
2006-07. Twenty to 33 percent of 
fees will be allocated to financial 
aid each year, compared with a 
current static H-percent return-
to-aid ratio. In addition, 
Schwarzenegger did not allocate 
state funding for ~-12 academic 
outreach programs in the compact 
agreement. 

"We feel that the compact mis-
represents the priorities of Stu-
dents, particularly the 7,000 
UCSD students who have 
expressed dissatisfaction with the 
fee increases," Pae said. 

The UC Board of Regents 
approved the proposed fee 
increases by a 14-2 vote at its May 
20 meeting. Former Student 
Regent Matt Murray and Marcus 
voted against the fee increases. 

"I'm not going to allow the 
university to deteriorate on my 
watch," Marcus said at the protest. 
"We're going to fight for the 
resources, we're going to get 
those resources and we're going to 
win with your action, your activi-
ties and your support." 

Angelides was the first 
statewide-eleeted official to object 
to the Schwarzenegger adminis-
tration 's budg~t cuts for higher 
education. InJanuary, he conduct-
ed a statewide tour of high school 
and college campuses to voice his 
concerns about the consequences 
of the proposed cuts. 

"We cannot affor~ to allow this 
great university system to be deci-
mated," Angelides said. "We can-
not turn the clock back on oppor-
tunity. We cannot allow this gov-
ernor to break a 4O-year compact 
with the people of California. We 
must once again say that we're 

going to educate as many young 
people as possible so California 
can lead the global economy in 
the 21 st century." 

According to Jarad Sanchez, 
vice president of external affairs 
for SDSU Associated Students, 
college students across the state 
have rallied together against the 
cuts. 

"For the last six months, we -
the students of the CSU, commu-
nity college and UC systems -
have stood together for one com-
mon cause, and that is to save our 
universities," Sanchez said at the 
protest. "We refuse to believe that 
erlucation is a privilege, not a 
right." 

Huffington, Bender and 
] ackson also spoke at the protest 
about the importance of higher 
education. 

"Going to school definitely 
helps to educate you in so many 
different ways," Jackson said. 
"People say to me, 'Half of the 
people in the music industry don't 
even finish ninth grade.' Jay-Z 
didn't finish eighth grade, but I 
mean, Jay-Z is one in [wo hun-
dred billion people that can 
become successful not doing 
that." 

According to Bender, who 
produced "Pulp Fiction" and 
both volumes of "Kill Bill," peo-
ple who go to college earn about 
$1 million more over the course 
of their careers than those who do 
not. 

"Each one of you can make a 
difference," Bender said. "Each 
one of you can go out there and 
raise some hell ... We can win this 
fight, imd all the people who have 
the grades can go to school like 
they're supposed to." 

Members of various groups 
protesting the budget cuts and fee 
increases were also present during

the rally. 

"[This issue] is really impor-
tant because (fee increases] are 
the last thing we need to be wor-
rying about as we're going into 
finals," said Earl Warren College 
senior Sara Johnson, and a mem-
ber of the San Diego Stop the 
Cuts Coalition. "We shouldn't 
have to be stressing about our 
fees next quarter. We should be 
able to focus on our finals and 
know that we're going to be able 
to afford our education next 
year." 

A spokesman for the governor 
did not return calls seeking com-
ment. 

Pae felt that the day's rally

While the study 
indicated that edu-

in the South," Johnson said. 
The Broolcings Institute study 

found that while the black migra-
tion to the South consists of people 
from all income levels, .profession-
als are moving away at slightly 
higher numbers. 

"Clearly, the North and the 
Midwest have to be concerned . . 
What is happening is very sim-
ilar to a brain-drain," Christian 
said. 

Christian defined the brain-
drain phenomenon in the migra-
tion context as "the depletion of a 
relatively wealthy population that 
continues to move out of non-
Southern areas." 

Because research has indicated 

black reverse 
migration, it found 

other factors as well. 
"Except for economic and edu-

cation reasons, the South has an 
additional appeal for Afri can 
Americans," Fry said. "Because of 
the history of the black population, 
the South is a more familiar territo-
ry." 

He added that while non-
Southern states will be heavil y 
impacted by the migration trends, 
the South will ultimately be the 
most altered. 

"It will change the social fabric 
and politics in the South," Fry said .

The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) has completed a Draft 
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the proposed campus Long Range 
Development Plan (LRDP), previously adopted by The Regents of the 
University of California in November 1989. The 2004 LRDP was updated 
to address anticipated growth in student enrollment and associated 
expansion of faculty, staff, academic and ancillary programs, and facilities. 
UCSD has prepared the 2004 LRDP Draft EIR to evaluate the potential 
environmental impacts of development projected in the 2004 LRDP. 
The 2004 LRDP EIR is a Program EIR that will be used at the program 
level in the environmental review of campus development through horizon 
year 2020-21. The 2004 LRDP EIR also provides project specific 
environmental analysis for three buildi~ projects currently being advanced 
for development: the Hopkins Parking Structure; San Diego Supercomputer 
Center Expansion; and the Rady School of Management. The LRDP EIR 
will serve as the basis for approval of these three projects. The 2004 
LRDP EIR addresses a fulJ range of environmental issues. A public hearing 
to take testimony on the Draft EIR for LRDP and projects will be held 
at the time and place stated below: 

Monday June 14, 2004, 6 P. M. In University Center, 
Administrative Complex, Bulldl", 111 A. 

Written and oral statements from Interested persons or groups will be 
accepted at the hearing for entry into the administrative records. A 
transcript of the hearing will be Included in the Final EIR. 
The 2004 LRDP EIR Is available for review and comment online 
at: http://physlcalplannlnl.ucsd.edu/LRDP2004/EIR/. The LRDP, EIR 
and reference materials used in the preparation of this EIR may be 
reviewed during normal operating hours at the UCSD Physical Planning 
Office. To call for an appointment, please contact Darlene NewelJ at 
858-534-6515 or dlnewellOUcsd,edu, Letters and statements may also 
be submitted for Inclusion in the record by writing: Jeffrey A. Steindorf, 
UCSD Campus Planning, 9500 Gilman Drive MC 0965, La Jolla, CA 
92093-0965. 

The public review period for the LRDP EIR will extend from May 26 
through July 9, 2004. All comments must be received by 5 p.m. on July 
9,2004. 

nrutISOAY, JUNE J, 2004 THE UCSD OUAJU>IAN 

Jobs: Average pay growing for new workers 
c:oruinued from page I 

n't really look for a job - I just 
got one. I got lucky." 

With the improving job mar-
ket, Schmidt believes that more 
students will enter the workforce 
directly, rather than going on to 
graduate school. Students often 
attend graduate school "to avoid 
facing a tough job market," he 
said. 

Last year, 40 percent of the 
graduating seniors continued on 
with graduate school, while 60 
percent went straight into the 
workforce, according to 
Schmidt. 

"We saw a higher percentage 
that went directly to grad school 
than directly to the job marleet," 
Schmidt said. "In previous 
years, there was a higher per-
centage that went directly into 
the workforce. On average, twO-
thirds [of the graduating class! 
went into the workforce and 
one-third went into grad school. 
My guess. is that, with the 
improving job market, we'll be 
more likely to see the one-third, 
two-thirds ratio, but it is too 
early to tell." 

Avoiding the job marke~ is not 
the only reason students attend 
grad school, he said. Many go to 

obtain a degree for their specified 
profession. 

"[I] will be attending graduate 
school here at UCSD to get my 
teaching credentials and master's 
degree through the Teacher 
Education Program because 1 
would like to be a teacher, and you 
have to get your credentials in 
order to do that," John Muir 

" 
... I would like to be a 

teacher, and you have to 
get your credentials in 

order to do that, " 
- ....... John"'CaIIIp 

senior 

senior Jenn Bader said. 
However, complete results 

from the senior alumni survey -
including figures on graduate 
school enrollment and average job 
salaries - will not be available 
until the beginning of 2005, as the 
survey will continue through the 
month of December. 

From the responses so far, 

Schmidt said that he is "seeing 
some positive results." 

These preliminary results 
include higher overall salaries. 
The average salary from the stu-
dents who graduated in June 
2002 and went directly into the 
workforce was $37,200, while 
the average salary for 2004 grad-
uates is 539,300, according to 
Schmidt. 

In previous years, the Career 
Services Center has held job 
search programs for graduated 
seniors. Due to financial and 
staffing problems, there will be no 
such program this year, though 
the center will still "be available 
for individual advising and coun-
seling and will plan other [similar) 
programs," according to 
Ceperley. 

"The successful ingredients of 
the program are still available," he 
said. 

Still, some seniors say they are 
concerned about the job marleet. 

"I think [that my biggest con-
cern) is finding a job," Earl 
Warren College senior Annie 
Kim said. "I am going to miss 
being in school. Everyone has 
this hope to be stable after grad-
uation and a fear - 'Will I be 
OK?'" 

Budget: Senator stipends fall by 58 .. percent 
continued from page I 

Sophomore Senator Lulu Ge said. 
"I think the mos~ responsible thing 
to do is to decrease their funding 
to $41,000." 

Another major point of debate 
was the allocation of funding for 
the annual Sungod festival. The 
original proposed budget stipu-
lated a supplemental allocation of 
S12,000 to be submitted from 
A.S. enterprises' income during 
second week of winter quarter 
next year for the event. Among 
others, A.S. Commissioner of 
Programming Rishi Shah 
expressed concern over whether 
this money would be available by 
next year. 

MI don't feel comfortable saying 
we're going to get the money from 
somewhere later on for Sungod," 
Pillon said. 

A motion to allocate anoth-
er $5,000 from general unallo-
cated funds to Sun god was 
passed by a 19-3-0 vote. 
Another motion to move an 
additional 57,000 from sepa-
rate unallocated funds to 
Sungod failed to pass by a 9-
10-1 vote. The issue of fund-
ing for Sungod will be 
reviewed again in the fall next 
year. 

The Academic 
Program will receive 
under the new budget, 

Success 
542,000 
which is 

almost a 10-percent increase from 
their funding t1iis year. 

Although content with ASP's 
funding, ASP director Terry Le 
was disappointed by the cuts to 
outreach funding. 

"This budget [crisis) has really 
gotten on my nerves," Le said. 
"I'm really torn between getting 
the funds for ASP and seeing 
other organizations ... that we'll 
be working with getting their 

" 1 think it's a really 00d 
precedent for A.S. to be 

[outreach's} sole source of 
funding after the state 

cuts. " 

funds cut." 
Although funding for the Excel 

Leadership Conference, which is 
run annually by the UCSD Greek 
community, was originally cut to 
57,200 for next year, the council 
moved to restore funding for the 
conference to current levels of 

S8,000. 
"I think that [Excel) is a huge 

priority for students, for about 
12,000 students [who attend)," 
Muir Freshman Senator Nam Bui 
said. 

Stipends for A.S. executives and 
leaders of student organizations also 
experienced cuts, with college sena-
tors experiencing the most drastic 
decreases. Senators' stipends were 
cut by almost SIO,OOO, or 58 per-
cent, for next year. 

A motion to cut senator 
sti pends al together failed to pass. 

Student Run Television did not 
experience any funding cuts in the 
final version of the budget. While 
satisfied, station manager Jared 
Lindo said extra money was need-
ed to replace damaged equipment. 

Triton Taxi received a 44 per-
cent increase in funding alloca-
tions compared to the budget 
passed last June. However, the 
program received supplemental 
funding this ye~ from money 
originally allocated for other pur-
poses. 

Overall, Pae felt that this year's 
budget discussion and final 
approval process went well. 

"There was a lot of input (and) 
a lot of constructive concerns," 
Pae said. "In light of the budget 
cuts, 1 feel that we need to be 
making sure that we're using the 
money as best as we can."

Race: Supreme Court ruling 
used as basis for legislation 

continued from page I 
President spokesman Hanan 
Eisenman. However, he did not 
think the bill would affect 
Proposition 209, an initiative voters 
passed in 1996 to ban affirmative 
action by public entities. 

"We want to meet with 
Firebaugh to discuss and compare 
our legal analyses," Eisenman said. 
"We don't think it would have an 
effect on our ability to consider 
race under Proposition 209." 

UCSD does not have sufficient 

" 

stitution does not, she aid. 
"In fact, Proposition 209 was 

intended to provide additional pro-
tection above the federal 
Constitution to completely prohibit 
preferential treatment and discrimi-
nation on the basis of race," said 
John Findley, a principal attorney 
for the Pacific Legal Foundation, a 
group which opposes government 
bureaucracy. "The courts were very 
clear in interpreting Proposition 
209: Government entities cannot 
gram preferential treatment." 

Icnowledfe on the 
details 0 the bill to 
take a position on 
it, said University 
Outreach 
Communications 
Director Pat 
Jacoby. • 

Advocates of the 
bill base their argu-
ment on the 
Supreme Court's 
2003 decision in 
the Grtltttr v. 
Bollingtr case, 
which challenged 
the University of 
Michigan's race-
based admissions 

We don't think [the 
~] would have an 
effect on OUT ability 

Therefore, by 
calling for "consid-
eration" of race, 
the bill does not 
pass muster with 
state statute, 
according to 
Findley. 

"The case law 
in state and federal to consider race 

under Proposition 
200. " 

courts say 
Proposition 209 
forbids the use of 
race in any form, 
even the classifica-
tion of race," 
Schachterle said. 
"So 'consideration'

of the President 
policies. The court ruled to allow 
closely tailored use of race for the 
goal of establishing diversity. 

"We felt the outcome was so 
inspiring that we need to make this 
available to all California students," 
Lara said. 

However, the American Civil 
Rights Coalition, a group that 
opposes racial preferences, believes 
the bill violates the guidelines set 
forth by the Supreme Court in the 
case, according to the ACRC's 
Director of Public Affairs Diane 
Schachterle. 

"[The Supreme Court) said 
that race-based programs may not 
be applied where race-neutral 
programs were shown to be suc-
cessful," Schachterle said. "[The 
decision) listed the states where 
race-neutral programs were work-
ing, and California was on that 
list. " 

The problem with using the 
Court's decision as the grounds for 
the bill is that in Michigan, laws 
allow for race-based admissions cri-
teria, while California's state con-

posed in the bill, violates that law." 
Proponents of the bill argue that 

because the bill explicitly bans giv-
ing benefits or preferential treat-
ment to specific races, it passes 
legal muster. . 

"The bill does not allow prefer-
ence and does not set quotas as in 
affirmati ve action pol icies," Lara 
said. "So long as no preference is 
given to [a particular group), we are 
within the law and not in violation 
of Proposition 209." 

However, challengers of the bill 
say that it will be impossible to con-
sider race in admissions without it 
setting any preferential treatment 
or discrimination toward that 
applicant. 

"The very act of considering 
race makes it a plus-or-minus fac-
tor," Schachterle said. "The bill 
will be challenged by us and other 
civil rights advocates, and it will be 
found unconstitutional." 

The bill will be sent to the tate 
Senate's Education Committee by 
June 9 before going to the gover-
nor for approval.

Study: New development 
planned in Sixth College 

continued from page A., 
cious. 

The new plan also considers the 
effects of a growing campus on stu-
dents' schedules, recommending 
the construction of any new acade-
mic buildings within an approxi-
mate eight-minute walking dis-
tance of University Center, accord-
ing to Peerson. 

"It looks really good to me," 
said Si~th College sophomore 
Greg Mallis, who serves as the A.S. 
representative on the planning 
committee that created the report. 
"It's loolcing really nice for Sixth 
College, as well as the rest of the 
neighborhood that they're plan-
ning. The only concerns that I have 
are about parlcing," 

Though the facilities recom-
mended by the proposal would 
eventually add 3,000 new parking 
spaces, most in a planned under-
ground structure below Warren 
Field, the study estimated that 800 
current spots would be lost during 
the process. 

However, Peerson said planners 
~ed that the removal of sur-
face parlcing lots would coincide 
with the creation of new spots, 
keeping the overall ratio of 0.41 
spaces per person OD campus. 

"What it means in the short 
tenn is that people in the neighbor-
hood (affected by construction] 
may have to walle a little further 
while there is construction, but for 
the overall campus number, we'll 
try very hard to stay to that ratio," 
she said. 

Funding for the various phases 
of the project would come from a 
combination of state and private 
contributions, according Schulte. 
For eumple, a donor will be 
sought for the 2,500-seat perfor-
mance center, after whom the facil-
ity will be named. The planners are 
also considering leasing portions of 
the area to private parties, who 
would be responsible for the cost of 

constructing a hotel, he said. The 
deal would be similar to a current 
construction project talcing place 
on university-owned land off cam-
pus. 

In addition, the San Diego 
Association of Governments voted 
in mid-November to fund the 
light-rail system, which will con-
nect the campus to Old Town and 
is expected to bring 4,000 people to 
the campus daily. 

While the e~pansion proposal 
would likely change the atmos-
phere at Sixth College and the sur-
rounding area, Sixth College 
freshman Kyla Buclcingham said 
the plan would revitalize this cur-
rently detached part of the cam-
pus. 

"It's quiet and peaceful here 
now - it's nice, but there just isn't 
a whole lot going on," said 
Buckingham, who lives in the 
Pepper Canyon aparttnents. 

During the preparatory stages 
before the study was drafted, stu-
dents met with architects in brain-
storming sessions, Wienhausen 
said. She ellpects more students 
from her college to get involved 
with the designing process for 
individual buildings. It's possible 
that the work could become an 
option for the upper-division 
practicurn required by the college, 
she said. 

"What I envision really is 
almost like going horne to a really 
good, well-functioning village;" she 
said. "What we want to create is 
not space, what we want to create is 
a place. A place really means some-
thing. A place has history, a place 
has charm, a place has a feeling to 
it. Space is just four walls and air 
between the walls, and that's not 
what we want." 

After public input and review by 
several campus committees, 
UCSD's new Chancellor Marye 
Anne Fox will decide whether to 
adopt the proposal.

Al8 SPORTS THE UCSD OUAIlDlAN THURSDAY. JUNE 3. 2004 

SENIOR SENDOFF 

Five soccer seniors depart after outstanding season 
Co-captain Shum led team with NCAA First Team All-American honors 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

The UCSD men's soccer team 
bids farewell to five seniors who 
have helped lead the team to its 
best Division II season, including 
a berth in the NCAA Division II 
National Championships, five 
California Collegiate Athletic 
Association conference honors 
and two NCAA All-American 
honors. Defender and co-captain 
Jonathan Shum, goalkeeper 
Jeremy Cookson, midfielder and 
co-captain Ryan Blair and mid-
fielders Alexis Tello and Ryan 
Mizumoto will graduate UCSD in 
June. 

Shum has ai1chored the Triton 
defense for four years and has 
started in all 18 games he played 
this past season. His strong defen-
sive play earned him an NCAA 
First Team All-American honor, a 
First Team A11 -CCAA selection 
and First Team All-Far West 
Region recognition for the 2003 
season. In the 2003 season, he was 
an integral part of the Triton 
defense that allowed more than 
twO goals in only three games and 
held the opposing team to a 1.6 
goals-per-game average. 

"Jon has been everything to us, 
and his All-American selection was 
very justified," UCSD head coach 
Derek Armstrong said. 

Shum cites making the NCAA 
playoffs for the first time as his 
proudest accomplishment. 

"During our four years, 1 feel 
that [we) seniors have laid a strong 
foundation for future teams, start-
ing as Division IT newcomers as 
freshmen and now as seniors. 
Hopefully (the team will remain) 
consistent contenders for the 
NCAA tournament," Shum said. 

Shum will remain at UCSD for 
one extra yea r to earn his master 's 
degree in microbiology as part of 
the Bachelor of Science/Master of 
Science program. He hopes to go 
to China to teach English and to 
eventually make his career as a 
high school teacher. 

"1 loved playing night games on 
our field," Shum said. "There was 
always an electric atmosphere for 

Ryan 
Blait 

those games. More than that 
though, I will definitely miss the 
times With my teammates both on 
and off the field." 

Fellow graduating senior 
Jeremy Cookson, also talked about 
Shum's contribution to the team 
over the years. 

"The biggest loss will be 
Shumrnie," he said. "He was a real 
leader on the field and his play 
helped hold the defense together." 

Cookson carved himself a suc-
cessful career as the Tritons' top 
goalie. As a freshman, he started 
all 18 games and tallied 70 saves 
and a 1.14 goals-against average. 
He missed most of his sophomore 
season with an injury but came 
back and played solidly in his 
junior and senior years. Cookson 
has played a total of 59 games with 
a 1.42 career GAA. 

"I have two proud accomplish-
ments," Cookson said. "First and 
foremost was getting to the NCAA 
tournament my senior year. A very 
close second is not losing to Cal 
State Dominguez Hills at all my 
sen ior year. After getting 
destroyed by them for three years 
straight, it was great to end on the 
right note." 

Cookson will receive hi~ degree 
in electrical engineering and will 
begin working for the United 
States Air Force doing systems 

I Club Sports 
Badminton 

The UCSD badminton team 
had another solid year, finishing the 
season undefeated for the second 
consecutive year and claiming the 
Southern California Collegiate 
Badminton League tide once again. 
With their solid talent, the bad-
minton team is quickly establishing 
itself as one of the premier teams in 
the nation. 

Cycling 
The mountain biking team had 

a solid showing toward the begin-
ning of the year, finishing seventh 
in the Western Collegiate Cycling 
Conference. One of its female rid-
ers, Christine Grasinski, had sever-
al first-place finishes throughout 
the season. The team performed 
best- at home, cleaning up the com-
petition at the UCSD-hosted 
Eucalyptus Grove event. 

The road bilcing team also had a 
good season, with several notable 
finishes at Boulevard, Mira Mesa 
College and UCLA. It also sent 
several individual riders, led by cap-
tain Joe Merlone, to nationals. 

Danccsport 
Finishing its season undefeated, 

the UCSD Dancesport team, led by 
captains Lindy Cabot and Lawrence 
Ortiguerra, landed nothing but 
first-place finishes, including wins 

at the San Francisco Open and in . 
Las Vegas. The team also hosted 
their sixth annual Day by the Shores 
in April, and the May Showcase. 

Dance Sport 
The UCSD dance team capped 

off the year with a third-place finish 
at the National Cheerleading 
AssociationINational Dance 
Association Collegiate Nationals in 
Daytona Beach, Fla., the largest and 
most competitive collegiate dance 
competition in the world. 'Ihis fin-
ish was the dance team's highest fin-
ish at nationals in four years. The 
team also took a first place win at 
the Cheerleaders of America 
Collegiate Championships. 

Equestrian 
Starting off their season strong 

on both the English and Western 
sides, the equestrian team began 
making waves in the Western 
Zone region. With new facilities at 
Del Mar Showpark and a pair of 
enthusiastic captains, Kate 
McComas and Maree Evans, the 
team did well this season. Final 
point totals at the end of the sea-
son put UCSD just one point 
behind University of San Diego in 
their region, but sent three riders, 
Linda Torres, Shannon Ward and 
co-captain Marce Evans, to 
nationals after finishing in the top 

testing on fighter aircraft at 
Edwards Air Force Base. 

"Jeremy has shown exemplary 
character, and it's been a privilege 
to coach him," Armstrong said. 

Cookson said he will miss team 
camaraderie the most when he 
leaves UCSD. 

"We all worked really hard 
together for a long time and got 
pretty close," Cookson said. "We 
fought through a lot together and 
had a great time doing it. The 
soccer has been fun, and the level 
of competition is something I'll 
definitely miss. But most of all, I 
think I'll just miss the team 
itself." 

Mizumoto has also helped 
UCSD's success during his four-
year career as a mid fielder. He 
started 45 of the 64 pmes he 
played . Lilc.e Cookson, he cites 
beating Cal State Dominguez 
Hills and making the NCAA play-
offs as his most important achieve-
ments. Mizumoto graduates with a 
degree in biology and plans on 
taking a year off before attending 
dental school. 

"I'm definitely going to ' miss 
my mates the most," Mizumoto 
said. "We have been through a lot 
together and I wish them all the 
best of luck in the future." 

Mizumoto feels optimistic 
about the team's future next season 

two of their class in the Western 
Zone. 

Icc Hockey 
The UCSD hockey team fin-

ished their season with seven wins, 
11 losses, and a tie. Although it was 
not its best season, the team did 
have spurts of success, including a 
suing of three victories over the 
University of Texas, UCLA and Cal 
State Northridge. 

Men's Lac:roue 
Under new coach John Hughes 

and with offensive all-star Nick 
Dean always on the attack, UCSD 
lacrosse had another solid season. 
With an overall record of 9-7, 
including an upset win over Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, UCSD 
climbed the 2004 polls, ranking as 
high as No. 16 in the nation. 

Women's Lac:rosIe 
After several tough seasons, the 

UCSD women's lacrosse team was 
looking to turn around. Under the 
direction of new coach Karen 
Lawrence, the team fought hard 
and squeaked out a few victories, 
led offensively by senior FJaine 
Lui. UCSD finished No. 6 in the 
Western Women's Lacrosse 
League. The team also earned a 
bid to compete in and host the 
WWLL playoffs. 

and expects the underclassmen to 
step up. 

"The team wiD definitely be 
exciting to watch," he said. "With 
so many influential seniors leav-
ing, strong leadership will be 
needed from the younger players." 

Blair, a local player out of 
University of San Diego High 
School, graduates with degrees in 
economics and political science. 
Blair has played a total of 60 
games at UCSD and suffered a 
season-ending injury that left him 
out of the conference and NCAA 
playoffs this year. 

"Ryan [Blair) is another very 
good character on our team," 
Armstrong said. "He added laugh-
ter and joy." 

Summers, an aerospace engi-
neering major, started all 18 games 
as a midfielder in his freshman 
year. The midfielder had his 
breakout year in 2001, leading his 
team in scoring with sill goals and 
13 points. He finished his career 
playing a total of 66 games wi rh 10 
goals and six assists totaling 30 
points. 

"Sean has been very consistent 
and had a really good career here," 
Armstrong said. 

Tello played midfielder for one 
season at UCSD in 2003. He 
played 14 games and tallied two 
goals for the season. 

Men's Ropy 
The men's rugby 

team's highlight this 
season was a big win 
over Long Beach State. 
The team looks to rebuild 
its lineup for next season. 

WOIIICll's RUJby 
Consistendy . one of the 

best teama UCSD has to offer, 
the women's rugby team finished 
another season undefeated and 
pushed their way far into the 
Collegiate Rugby Championships 
scheme before being eliminated by 
Penn State. The team reworked 
their dynamics for this season, . 
moving several key players and 
stressing the need for teamwork. 
The changes seemed to have paid 
off, especially after earning key vic-
tories over UC Santa Barbara and 
Arizona. 

SeiIiag 
The sailing team capped its sea-

son with • pair of strong showings 
at San Fnncisco Bay and the 
Women's Pacific Coast 
Chaml::hips in Hawaii. The 
team . ed fourth in the south-
ern standings. With continuing 
support of alumni and pterous 
donations, UCSD sailing hopei to 
continue to 1M'" and fi,ht for top 
honon. 

"Alexis has been injured quite a 
lot, unfortunately, but he was a 
valuable member of this club," 
Armstrong said. 

Although the familiar faces of 
Shum, Cookson, M.izumolo, Blair, 
Summers and Tello will be missing 
on the field, the future looks 
bright for men's soccer, with many 
of the conference honors retum-
ing next season. Cookson is opti-
mistic that the underclassmen will 
step up. 

"[Even with the loss of Shuml, 
the defense is still in great shape, 
with Kevin (Murray), Rob 
(Stetina], Garret [King], Lulc.e 
[Russell), not to mention some of 
the sophomores," Cookson said. 
"Defensively, they'll do fine. 
Offensively, [the team still has 
(Matthew) Davey, Don] 
Krupanskr, [Brett] Maurer and 
[Grant) Nishio. I would say that 
the team will miss us seniors, but 
they're going to go even further 
next year." 

Reflective of his strong work 
ethic as a captain, Shum also added 
that hard work will be essential to 
next season's success. 

"There is quite a lot of talent 
on the team but their talents will 
only take them so far," Shum said. 
"It will be their hard work which 
will propel them past the team's 
achievements last season." 

SaowSIdiag 
Traveling to Mammoth 

Mountain on a near-weekly basis, 
the snow skiinr team, led by cap-
tain Parriclt WJlcoz, is one of the 
hardest-competing teams 00 cam-
pus. Overall, UCSD snow skiing 
finished second in the Southern 
California Collegiate Snowsport 
Conference, although many of its 
skien finished in tint. The female 
skien, led by senior ncer Danielle 
Crocbtt, won almost every event 
during the season.

the virtue of hard work and team-
work in his four years. His ~­
plary character won him the 
respect of his coaches and team-
mstes as well. 

"Higinbotham came back to 
UCSD tennis as a fifth year senior," 
Steidlmayer aid. "He has been one 
of the main reasons Triton tennis is 
where it is today. Earning the leader-
ship award &om his teammates 
speab for what Sean has meant to 
our team this year. He has played in 
the starting lineup when Deeded and 
has ahnys pushed himIelf and his 
teammates to bener themseha." 

Higginbotham will enroll in 
Officer Training Scbool for the 
U.S. Navy and hopes to work in its 
nuclear power depamnent. 

Whether it was playinr in the 
clutch, setting records or providing 
leadership on and off the court, 
each of the six departinJ seniors 
has etched an indehble mark in 
UCSD men's tennis history. 

Team Up: Del Mar Heights thanks UCSO athletes 
CUI'UiIwtd from ". A20 

volunteer athletes) play games with 
kids like hula-hoop and throwing 
the football [0 each other ... multi-
tasking things," Del Mar Heights 
fifth-grader James Lewis said. 

The purpose of the Team Up 
prorram was to address the lack of 
P.E. classes at Del Mar Heights 
Elementary. 

"Team Up bepn with a whole 
bunch of different people's ideas," 
Del Mar Heights teacher and Team 
Up orpnizer Paip Rollins said. "It 
came &om our principal [Wendy 
Wardlow) and I dedicated parent at 
our IChool who wantaJ the lcids to 
be Ictive and have fun before 
tchool and during school." 

There are approllimately 497 
students enrolled It Del Mar 
Heights between kindergarten and 
sixth pde. Team Up is open to all 
students interested in participating. 

"It was really fun [0 haft Team 
Up here because it wasn't very fun 
when you don't know what tlJ do, 
and then you can play with Team 
Up and have fun," second-grader 
Heather Loping said. 

Team Up athletes have grown to 
become a vital pan of the school, 
making a difference in the students' 
and teachen' lives. 

"They've had not a little impact 
but a huge impact," Rollins said. 
"The kids at recess are happy; they 
like to go outside. Everyone is 
included and there are no outsiders. 
They include everybody - every-
one is valuable and everyone is hav-
ing fun. And it carries over because 
teachers don't have as lOany disci-
pline problems." 

In additioo, students haft funned 
strong bonds with the athletes, 
according to Rollins. Many kids look 

up to the athletes as their mentIll'S 
who instill in them the drift to suc-
ceed and hopefully become athletes 
and scholars one day. 

Team Up has also fostered 
friendships between students from 
different grade levels, and with the 
inclusion of every student in the 
games, it has broken down cliques 
and kepr new ones from fonning -

important.

"rream Up] has been such a joy 
[0 us this year and I hope they will 
keep coming back," Wardlow said 
at the assembly. 

In addition, 22 students stepped 
up to the microphone and briefly 
spoke about Team Up. Some men-
tioned that the athletes inspired 
them to become more active and 
some thanked the athletes for sacri-
ficing their time. 

"I like Team Up because they 
tab: their time out of their day to 
just play with us and have fun, " sec-
ond-grader Tessa Martin said. 

The children have also made an 
impact on the Triton athletes and 
many hope to continue the pro-
gram next year. 

"It's a lor of fun," Siam said. 
"We literally sit around and talk 
about the stuff that we do here, 
what kids said what and what kids 
did what."

Men's tennis seniors serve it ,up for the last time 
Stellar group of men's tennis players conclude their tenure as Tritons 

By CYNTHIA BLADE CHAVEZ 
Sports Editor 

After playing a crucial role in 
leading UCSD men's tennis ro its 
best season in Division 11 , includ-
ing its first appearance in the 
NCAA National Championships, 
six players have competed in their 
last match for UCSD. Sameer 
Chopra, Jeff Wilson, Nick 
Marron, ·.Amir Nejad, Sean 
Higginbotham and Emil Novak 
are graduating in June, each leav-
ing their marks on the men stennis 
program. 

Chopra ends his career at 
UCS)) havi ng played at the top 
si ngles and doubles lineup for most 
uf hi s ca reer. His final singles rank-
ing of No. 14 and doubles ranking 
of o. 2 earned him an NCAA A11 -
American selection in singles and 
doubles - a first for any Triton 
tennis player in Division II. 

"Chopra's growth over the five 
years at school was extraordinary," 
head coach Eric Steidl mayer said. 
"In ~is last year, he brought leader-
shi p on court, a true love for the 
game, as well as a very high caliber 
of play." 

Chopra graduates with 3 degree 
in psychology and plans on attend-
ing medical school. Chopra ends 
his collegiate tennis career with a 
40-36 singles record and a 61-35 
doubles record. 

Wilson, Chopra's doubles part-
ner, 31 a placed himself in the 
record books with an NCAA A11-
American selection in doubles and 
by breaking UCSD's record for 
career wins in doubles with 68 
wins. 

Wi Ison will receive his degree 
in management science and will 
attend law school at University of 
San Francisco in the fall. 

"[Wilson] had wins at No. I 
through No. 4 in ingles this year 
and was definitely willing to play 
hard wherever he ended up," 
Steidlmayer said. "His flexibility 
and desire to see his team do well 
was great for the whole quad." 

In his four years at UCSD, 
Wilson holds a 66-35 singles 
record and a 68-35 doubles record. 

Morton was a doubles specialist 
for the Tritons, finishing his ca reer 
with a 38-11 doubles record and a 
7-5 singles record. He and his dou-
bles parmer, sophomore Brent 
Molden, stepped up for UCSD 
this sea on and played consistently, 
pulling off crucial victories at No. 
3 doubles. 

"Morton finishes his year with 
style, earning a doubles win versus 
West Florida, the eventual nation-
al champion," Steidlmayer said. 
"His win at the national champi-
onships gave us a chance [Q win the 
whole match. He really ' played 
well, and brought his game up to 

the level it needed to be in order to 
garner the victory." 

Morton will graduate with a 
degree in biochemistry and plans 
to attend dental school. 

After playing for his first twO 
years, Nejad took a year off as a 
junior to concentrate on his stud-
ies, setting his sights for medical 
school. He returned to the squad 
for his senior year and consistently 
contributed in doubles and in sin-
gles. 

"Nejad also came through in 
the clutch for UCSD this spring," 
Steidlmayer said. "Amir played the 
match of bis career at nationals 
when he and [Bryan Swatt] defeat-
ed the No. 23 -ranked team in the 
country to give UCSD the edge." 

Nejad graduates with a degree 
in political science and has already 
received acceptance letters from 
medical schools. He will anend 
medical school in the fall. 

Novak finished his management 
science degree in three years and 
will also graduate in June. While at 
UCSD, he has been one of the most 
reliable singles players, setting the 
school record for career singles 
wins in a season with 20 in 2002 . 
He also set a new record as the all-
time winning percentage leader in 
singles. In his three years at UCSD, 
Nowk has a 57-18 singles record 
and an 8-6 doubles record. 

"He was [aJ rock for three

years, bringing a fighting spirit and 
solid groundstrokes to every 
match," Steidlmayer said of 
Novak. 

Novak plans on finding a full-
time job after he graduates. 

Higginbotham, like Ne;ad, took 

a year off in 2003 to concentrate on 
his schoolwork. Graduating with a 
degree in mechanical engineering, 
Higginbotham has provided lead-
ership for the team and exemplified

UCSD softhall will lose short-
stop Kim Aggahao, pitcher and 
first baseman Jodie Bland and 
third baseman Amy Mcnee when 
the seniors graduate. 

Aggabao, a co-captain who 
plays both shortstop and second 
base, was se lected as the California 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
2004 Most Valuable Player, the 
first time a Triton has ever 
received this honor for softball. In 
addition to CCAA MVP, Aggabao 
earned Fi rst Team all -CCM hon-
ors for the third straight year and 
was selected to the Division II A11-
West Region Second Team, her 
first time appearing on the hon-
orary tea m. She led the league 
with a A ll batting average and fell 
just short of the all-time school 
record of.4 15, set by Erin Bridges 
in 2000. Aggabao also led the 
league in doubles, with 23, and set 
a school record at the same time. 
Playing in all 56 of the team's 
games this season, she also led 
UCSD with 38 RBIs, her second 
straight year of knocking in the 
most nllls. 

or stopping there, Aggabao 
touched more bases than any 
Triton, with 104 total bases, and 
fini shed the season with a slugging 
percentage of .638, while scoring 
32 runs. She blasted all four of her 
collegiate home runs this season 
and also played solid defense, 
turning in a .948 fielding percent-
age. Aggahao will leave UCSD in 
the top-six of six different cate-
gories in all -time UCSD softball 
leaders.

honors is fellow co-captain 

CIIrinI."../Ciuardian file 
The biB shots: Pitcher Jodie Bland, shortstop Kim Aggabao and third baseman /vny Mettee were the seniors who carried 
the Triton softball team through the highs and lows of the 2004 season. 
Menee. This is Mettee's fourth 
selection to the all-CCAA team: 
She earned Second Team honors 
in her freshman year and took a 
spot on the First Team for the next 
three years. Mettee also joins 
Aggabao on the All-West Region 
Second Team, her fourth appoint-
ment in four years. She made 
Second Team as a freshman and 
then earned First Team honors in 
both her sophomore and junior 
years. 

Mettee will be leaving quite a 
legacy behind at UCSD, exiting 
with the lead in five categories for 

the school as well as two second-
place finishes. She ended the year 
batting .309 and led the team with 
two triples, 45 runs and 22 stolen 
bases. Mettee's all-time first-place 
stats include hits, with 256; dou-
bles, with 48; home runs, with 18; 
runs, with 162; and assists, with 
544. She will depart from UCSD 
second in both triples and stolen 
bases, with 16 and 70, respectively. 

Bland served as the workhorse 
of the Triton pitching ruff this year, 
pitching a team-leading 165.1 
innings, while emerging with a 
team-leading 13 wins. Going 13-13 

on the season, she finished with a 
3.05 ERA and kept opponents to a 
.302 batting average. Bland started 
25 games, more than any other 
Triton, and appeared in 29 games, 
also a team high. In addition, she 
earned UCSD's lone save of the 
season. Striking out 25 and only 
walking 23, Bland also maintained a 
.996 fielding percentage, commit-
ting only one error on the season, 
netting 173 puto~. 

Pitching wasn't Bland's only 
skill, however, as she proved her-

Sports Editor 

If you have so much as glanced at 
sports headlines during the year, you 
know that UCSD athletes have bro-
ken several school and national 
records, gone to the playoffs (some ' 
for the first time) and competed for 
national championships. In addition 
to juggling an already rigorous 
schedule of school and sports, many 
athletes willingly sacrifices free time 
to make a difference in the San 
Diego community. 

Junior Karina Siam of the UCSD 
womens basketball team is one of 
about 18 athletes who gets up at the 
crack of dawn to hold 7 a.m. infor-
mal physical education classes for 
students at Del Mar Heights 
Elementary School. Siam is a part of 
Team Up, which was formed to pro-
vide students with fun physical activ-
ities before and during school hours. 

"We have to get up [around 5 
a.m.] for this, and it's a lot easier 
than getting up for class," Siam said. 
"You get here and once you see the 
kids, you get energized. You leave 
here with energy and you're happy. " 

Team Up athletes also stop by 
during recess at Del Mar Heights to 
play pick-up games of baseball, soc-
cer and basketball or to teach kids 
how to hula-hoop and jump rope.

Love Me if You Dare 

It's a love story about two kids who grow up only to real-
ize they were always meant to be together. Sounds old, but 
this French movie adds a twist by introducing a dynamic 
relationship between Julien (Guillaume Canet) and Sophie 
(Marion Cotillard), in which each is continually daring the 
other to undertake outrageous requests. This will most like-
ly be an intense fairy tale that the majority of American 
moviegoers might have difficulty understanding, but for 
those who like dark comedies and French romances, this is a 
must-see.

Garfield: The Movie 

The rotund, lasagna-loving feline gets a CGI remake in 
this feature-le ngth comedy where Garfield finds himself try-
ing to rescue the kidnapped dog Odie. With Bill Murray as 
the voice of wrfield, and the voice talents of others like Alan 
Cumming ("X2", "Emma"), Debra Messing ("Will and 
Grace") and Brad Garrett ("Everybody Loves Raymond"), 
this film could set the bar for other cartoon and comic-to-
film adaptations. But then again, Jennifer Love Hewitt plays 
a veterinarian who woos the lovesick J on Arbuckle (Breclcin 
Meyer). This film dangerously hovers over the trash or trea-
sure line. 

The Chronicles of Riddick 
Vin Diesel returns to the role of Richard P. Riddick in this 

sequel to "Pitch Black" (2000). Five years after the end of the 
first film, the sequel finds Riddick trying to escape his sub-
terranean prison on the planet Helion. Riddick somehow 
becomes man's only hope for survival against the super-evil 
Necromongers, who want to take over the universe. No one 
can playa no-nonsense musclehead like Vin Diesel, so if he 
doesn't have to speak, then he may have a winner here. Judi 
Dench will add an air of gravity to a film that could otherwise 
be laughable, but the special effects and action sequences will 
have sci-fi addicts and action-flick junkies flooding theaters in 
droves. .

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

seems. lbis remake of the 1975 sci-fi thriller adds humor to 
the original story with an all-star cast th.t includes 
Christopher Walken, Bette Midler and Glenn Close. Kidman 
has failed to do wrong since her split up with Tom Cruise, 
and this doesn't look like it will stray from her strelk of win-
ning films.

Around the World in 80 Days 

Jackie Chan is billed as crackpot inventor Phileas Fogg's 
(Steve Coogan) side-kicklassistantlbutler, Passepartout, who is 
evading capture after stealing a valuable relic. In this remake of 
the 1956 film based on the Jules Verne novel, Chan is touted as 
the box-office draw for his martial artsIcomedy skills, while 
Coogan ("24 Hour Party People," "Coffee and Cigarettes") is 
relegated to second billing with the rest of the 6rst-rate ensem-
ble cast, including Jim Broadbent, John Cleese, Kathy Bates 
and Owen Wuson among others. Expect lightheaned fun with 
lots of action and humor, but this will by no means be an 
award-winner. 

Saved! 
Mandy Moore, Macaulay Cullcin and Eva Amurri are get-

ting rave reviews for this dark comedy set in an u1tra-conser-
vative Christian school. Hilary Faye (Moore) is the head of an 
all-girl clique that ostracizes Mary Oena Malone) after she 
gets pregnant. Mary then befriends other eutcasts (Cullcin, 
Amurri) when her friends tum on her. Produced by Michael 
Stipe and showcasing the talents of mday's most promising 
young actors, "Saved!" is more than just another teen drama. 
Expect biting humor and social criticism that will have you 
begging for more. 

June 18 
The Terminal 

Tom Hanks is an immigrant in the United States on his 
way home when his tiny Eastern European country breaks 
out in war and gets erased off the map, forcing him to remain 
in the airport. Hanks has proven that no one can pl.y down-
trodden like he can with films like "Philadelphia" and "Joe 
Versus the Volcano," and with Steven Speilberg at the helm 
and with a cast that includes Catherine Zeta-JoneS, Chi 
McBride, Diego Luna and Stanley Tucci, it looks like we have 
a winner on our hands.

Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story 
Peter La Fleur (V'mce Vaughn) caI1s on the help of a misfit, 

rag-tag group of friends to save his local gym from the clutches 
of a monster cIWn of gyms by entering a dodgeball competi-
tion. This is a Ben Stiller movie, so whit more needs to be said) 
Goofy, physical humor with plot coming in secondary to the 
action are par for the course. See this if you're a fan of the 
Farrelly Brothers or National Lampoon's movies. 

June 23 
White Chicks 

The Wayans brothers dress up and try to pass themselves 
as white heiresses in order to protect the real heiresses from 
being lcidnapped. The plot is preposterous, the humor is lame 
and the makeup is even worse. \\!ho came up with this idea 
and who let them tum this into 3 movie? They need to be 
shot. 

June 25 
The Notebook 

Another Nicholas Sparks period romance drama. There's a 
promising, good-looking young cast and a script thlt will pro-
voke lots of sighs and lots of crying. The ladies will love it.

Spider,Man 2 

Peter Parker (fobey Maguire) encounters a deluge of per-
sonal problems while his arch-enemy and best friend Oames 
Franco) employs the tentacled Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) 
to destroy his alter ego, Spider-Man. Impressive special 
effects, heart-tugging sentiment, rippling bodies and a badass 
Molina will make this film a summer winner. 

July 7 
King Arthur 

In this updated retelling of the King Arthur tiles, the leg-
end of King Arthur is (supposedly) more historically accurate, 
placing the story within its historical context amid feudal wars 
and the collapse of the Roman Empire. Clive Owen is the 
manly Arthur and Kiera Knightly is the clever, warrior-
princess Guinevere, who remakes the image of the frilly 
d.msel in distress. Heart-stopping action, smart writing and 
.ttention to historical detail should make this film awesome. 

July 9 
Anchorman 

Will Ferrell is at it again. This time he's the pompous 
news anchor Ron Burgundy, who comes face-to-face with a 
feminist journalist (Christina Applegate) who gives him a run 
for his money. 

His roles may seem repetitive, but Ferrell has a knack 
for offbeat humor. Having co-written and starred in the 
film, he falls into a role that is a perfect fit for him yet 
again. Expect another comedic winner from Ferrell with 
"Anchorman."

I, Robot 

Robots threaten to take over 
humanity, but don't worry, Will 
Smith (Detective Del Spooner) 
will save the world . The film con-
tains lots of CGI animation and 
special effects, but the futuristic, 
sci-fi plot looks entirely pre-
dictable and ridiculous. It is just 
another brainless summer block-
buster with fancy graphics that 
will sadly garner masses at the box 
office. 

July 23 
Catwoman 

Directed by visual effects 
wizard Pitof, "Catwoman" will 
be more than just another excuse 
to have Halle Berry parade 
around in a skintight, barely 
there leather costume. Patience 
Phillips (Berry) becomes part 
hero, part animalistic criminal 
when she is lcilled and reborn as 
a woman with cat-like powers. 
Berry is a talented actress who 
sometimes has questionable taste 
in films (like "Die Another 
Day"), so let's hope this one is 
one of her good ones. 

------, 

Zatoichi: The Blind 
Swordsman 

Takeshi Kitlno (aka Beat 
Takeshi) has become a household 
name in Japan for such hits as 
"Battle Royale" and "Sonatine," 
and also as a comic actor. Kitano 
revives the "Zatouchi" samurai 
film series with a good deal of 
gusto and offbeat humor. 
Transgendered geisha, half-naked 
idiots and dance numbers are 
defining elements of this one-of-
a-lcind film. And don't miss the 
stellar performance of the 
Japanese Johnny Depp, Tadanobu 
Asano.

The Village 

M. Night Shyamalan has got 
that magical, golden touch, 
which he's proven with films like 
"The Sixth Sense" and "Signs." 
"The Village" looks like it will 
be blessed with the same degree 
of assiduous detail and intensity 
as Shyamalan's other films. 

Shyamalan has employed some 
of the most talented in the busi-
ness Ooaquin Phoenix, Bryce 
Howard, William Hurt, 
Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody) 
to make a film that will be spine-
tingling in all the ways that made

June is finally here, and with longer days, no school and menial jobs comes, of course, the 
summer concert season. It appears 
that the days of tours for every sub-
culture are over: Lilith Fair is dead, 
Summer Sanitarium is dead, the 
SmokeOut is dead. But 
Lollapalooza is back and should be 
great, Ozzfest is still head banging 
away, and Bonnaroo looks like the 
best music festival that no one from 
the West Coast will attend. In addi-
tion to the big-money tours, all 
your favorite bands are on the road 
for the next few months, so make up 
for your Kazaa library by going out 
and showing some support. \\!hile 
finals week still looms, here are a 
few heads-up to start planning your 
summer. 

Lollapalooza 
Lollapalooza organizers appar-

ently got the message that their fes-

that Lollapalooza 2004 lives up to

without Sonic Youth, and they'll 
perfonn their artsy, minimalist rock 
along with the return of the 
maudlin Englishman Morrissey, PJ 
Harvey, Modest Mouse and Le 
Tigre. Indie-rock heroes the 
Walkmen, Sparta and Broken Social 
Scene will supply the requisite pow-
erchording ... and this is only the 
first day. 

The second full day of 
Lollapaloo1.3 2004 will be headlined 
by jazzy-jammers the String Cheese 
lnciden t, psychogeezers the 
Flaming Lips and amazing art-
folkies Wileo. If you needed any

Ozzfest 
Ozzy Osbourne has a permanent

Ozzfest tour will yet again feature 
some of the most tried -and-true 
bands in heavy metal. 

Ozzy's original band, the genre-
defining Black Sabbath (who swore 
a few years ago that that year's tour 
would be their last) will of course 
headline, along with the tight-pant-
ed Judas Priest and death-rock 
debu tantes Slayer. 

Hatebreed, Black Label Society, 
Sliplrnot, Dimmu Borgia, Bleeding

bill for summer 2004's most uplift-

Van Peeble's new work is 
one 'Baadasssss' film 
Faux documentary and quirky comedic 

elements make this film a must-see 
By CUFFORD HILO 

Staff Writer 

What a sweet and endearing film "Baadasssss" is. It reads like a heartfelt prayer, gen-
uine in its unflinching truthfulness, 
delivered by a son to his father in 
anxious tones. And it quite literally 
is. In the film, actor/director Mario 
Van Peebles pays homage dually to 
his own actor/director father 
Melvin Van Peebles by assuming the 
lead character of his dad and direct-
ing "Baadasssss" 
itself. When watch-

" 

the film . In one particular scene, he 
decides it is best to let his film crew 
stew in jail for a weekend rather 
than risk ruining the filming sched-
ule. In another, he rigidly demands 
that his pre-pubescent son, Mario, 
have sex with a prostitute for the 
openin g sequence of "Sweetback." 

As a kind of faux documentary 
about the making of "Sweetback," 
with interviews from the actors and 
clips of the original film, 
"Baadasssss" is full of charming and 
engaging anecdotes. It's funny to see 

ing the Melvin-based 
ch~racter launch into 
fits of invariable and 
violent fr ustration, 
it's both depressing 
and touching to 
know that Mario has 
had fi rst-hand expe-
rience with his 
fat her's own sturm 
and drang. T he 
fi lm watches a terri-
fyi ng and stern

With a startling 
vision of a film ...

sidekicks, and

tension explodes in

upon burgeoning

Earth, Wind and 
Fire only because 
Melvi n 's secretary, 
Patricia , is the 
girlfriend of one

times it's not so 
funn y, such as 
when Melvin 
sta rts losing sight 
in his left eye in

ing "Sweetback."

the stars are "Bruthas and Sistahs," 
blacks aren't reduced to laughable 
Sidekicks, and see thing racia l [I;n-

Van Peebles pursued the completion 
of "Sweetback" with a great amoun t 
of difficulty. He pushes everyone, 
including fi nanciers, fr iends and 
fami ly to the point that he appears a 
sadistic tyrant, obsessed with the 
seemingly qu ixotic completion of 

scopic specificity 
and detail in recounting the strug-
gling production of "Sweetback," 
"Baadasssss" is fascinating for its 
documentary worth. While the 
humorous and wistful accounts are 
interesting enough as documentary, 
the film is still dramatic fiction . 
Sure, there are points in the film 
that stack emotion and sentimental-
ity thicker than a ham sandwich, but 
it 's forgivable. At these moments, 
one can almost hear Mario Van

Mexican director spices up Potter 
UK's best form cast of the highly anticipated third film 

By ANNE CONG-HUYEN 
Hiatus Editor 

It's been two years since the last Harry Potter movie and a lot has changed since then. The child 
stars have hit puberty, Alfonso 
Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien," "A 
Little Princess") successfully talces 
the reigns as director and interna-
tionally recognized English actors 
flood the screen in this adaptation of 
J,K. Rowling's third Harry Potter 
boole. 

In the third installment of the 
series, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) 
returns to Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry for his 
third year of supernatural school-
ing only to collie face-to-race with 
a real killer wizard. The bespecta-
cled Harry is again joined by his 
friends l the too-cute Hermione 
Granger (Emma Watson) and the 
hysterically humble Ron Weasely 
(Rupert Grint) , as he, now a hot-
blooded teenager, goes on his 
greatest adventure yet. 

This time, the filmmakers do 
not disappoint, and a whole cast of 
first-rate British actors fill the 
shoes of the adults to perfection . 
Gary Oldman is frighteningly real-
istic and yet human as the escaped 
murderer Sirius Black. His frail yet 
psychotically driven character 
could not have been any better. 
Emma Thompson delights as the 
bug-eyed Divination teacher 
Professor Trelawney with a great 
degree of hilarity. David Thewlis is 
touching as the mysteriously 
dodgy Professor Lupin, while 
Michael Gambon more than satis-
factorily takes over as Professor 
Dumbledore, who was previously 
played by t~e late Richard Harris. 

Sadly, Radcliffe disappoints in 
the lead role with a rather wea~ 
performance. To his credit, 
though, he's got the teenage punk 
act down to a tee, and he nails the 
bitter angry scenes better than any 
other. The good news is that he is 
surrounded by an otherwise stellar 
cast. Watson, who showed herself 
to be a highly skilled actress in 
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of 

" To his credit, though,

act down to a tee, and 
he nails the bitter angry

other. The good news is

cast." 

Secrets," again delivers a subtly 
poignant performance with just as 
much humor as emotion. Without 
a doubt though, Grint is one of the 
most endearing characters as the 
smart-ass, broken-voiced, red-
haired Ron. He contributes to 
much of the film 's humor. 

Cuaron must be credited for 
directing the teens so that they 
behave and interact like real teens 
with believable pubescent chem-
istry. Watching Ron yell and pout 

Film 
REVIEW 

about Rennione's scrunched-face 
cat one minute and then screaming 
about spiders in moments of half-
asleep delirium the next makes this 
ride that much more enjoyable. 

Although not entirely faithful 
to the boole, the film is not com-
promised by artistic liberties, and 
Cuaron delivers a strong film that 
can stand on its own. The acting, 
for the most pan, is incredibly 
strong, special effects are used bril-
liantly and discretionally, and the 
character interactions are entirely 
believable. 

Cuaron has raised the 
respectability of the Harry Potter 
film franchise from simply movies 
based on booles by offering a strong 
film with frightening monsters and 
enemies, breathtaking views of the 
Hogwarts' grounds and clever 
jokes even parents will enjoy. The 
film's chilling plot is infused with 
the same amount of good humor 
and lightheartedness that accompa-
nies the booles, and under Cuaron's 
care, "Harry Potter and the 
Prisoner of Azlcaban" becomes a 
fun and worthwhile cinematic 
experience, rather than just anoth-
er lame adaptation.

If you like your summer music with 
a few kickflips and backside 50-50

be just your thing. 

The annual summer tour fea-
tures the best in high-energy punk 
rock on multiple stages, extreme 
SP OrtS demos on vert ramps and 
street courses and in famous mosh 
pits. 

This year's huge bill includes 
Coheed and Cambria, Anti -Flag,

NOFX, the Aquabats, the

KROQ Weenie Roast

KROQ queen: Karen 0 and the Yeah

Weenie Roast this year. 

The Beastie Boys are back on the 
scene this summer after a long hia-
tus from the music world. The boys 
willheadline this year's KROQ 
Weenie Roast and will perform 
along with the Strokes, Bad 
Religion and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. 
The benefit show will be held yet 
again at the sweltering Verizon 
Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine, 
Calif. 

Also performing will be Vdvet 
Revolver, Yellowcard, the Hives, 
Cypress Hill, Modest Mouse, Story 
of the Year and A New Found Glory. 

A word to the wise: They don't 
call it a weenie rout because they 
give out free hot dogs - they call it a 
weenie roast because you are like a 
weenie roasting in the sun. So take a 
hint - unless you want to spend the 
days after resembling a lobster, bring 

the sun blode, whitey. 

The MTV2 Projekt

M1V's ever-tightening grasp on 
the youth eDtertainment world will 
get a litde firmer this summer as 
MTV2 tries to show it bows who

metal nobles Linkin Parle, Korn 
(who still exist?) and the Used. 
Somewhere between the sets of 
emo-metal, Snoop Dog will enter-
tain the pale-skinned masses with 
his usual pimp-wric hip-hop.

Disney returns with the second

another film sure to delight. The

the lead role as Princess Mia of 
Genovia, who needs a husband 
before she can take the crown. The 
film is not based on the second

brought to life with good-looking 
teens, and if anything, this alone 
will sell the movie.

When ancient China was divid-
ed into seven different kingdoms, 
one king feared assassination and 
promised riches to any man who 
could kill his three main enemies. 
Miraculously, Nameless, Oet Li) a

of these warriors and recounts the 
histories of his battles. Cool martial 
arts and an enthralling story from

THlJIlSDAY,JUNE 3,2004 

The Delays might be the wimpiest band to come out of Briuin in a 
while, but don't hold it 
against them. The shiny pop 
these lads create on their 
debut sounds so re&eshingly 
unlike most modern bands 
simply because of how will-
fully gorgeous it is. 

In the United Kingdom, 
the Delays have a couple of 
hits, but to gain an 
American audience, their 
biggest obstacle will be 
Greg Gilbert's elUemely 
effeminate vocals. Along 
with shimmering layers of 
processed guitars and har-
monies, the band's sound 
most clearly lends itself to 
comparison with female-
fronted dream-pop band the 
Cocteau Twins. 

However, the vocals in 
particular are what set the 
band apart. In a musical cli-
mate where male singers are 
rewarded for forcing angst, 

we need the Delays. 
OccasionaUy, the music 

grows too nebulous or 
melodramatic, such as on 
"There's Water Here; 
which sounds so theatrical 
it could be sung by a Disney 
princess. But even the 
toughest customer won't be 
able to resist "Nearer Than 
Heaven, • a song evel'y bit as 
blissful as its name suggests. 
Wavering guitars and key-
boards wrap around lush 
vocal harmonies as Gilben 
swoops &om high to low 
octaves gracefully. The '60s 
pop of "Hey Girl" and the 
surprising electronic 
bounce of "Stay Where You 
Are" are also highlights. 
The Delays don't quite 
"rock,· to be sure, but 
F /ldtd St/lsiat Glntoflr is 
like a fleeting summer 
romance - slight but 
sweet.

album 

POP this album into your CD player and your first impulse will be to 
scan through the depress-
ingly mundane songs as 
quicldy as possible. That's 
the priuwy reaction created 
by Pedro the Lion's fifth 
album, Atbillu Hrti. 

However, if you give the 
album a second chance, 
momentarily tuDe out the 
actual music and focus on 
the lyrics, you'll find a 
strange twinge of emotion. 
Frontman David BaWl in 
fact delivers some very 
heartfelt and strong mes-

Unfortunately, you're 
buying music and not a

of the album is pretty much 
the bad pan. Even with a

appeal, the album fails to 
exude any exceptional 
efforts. 

The whole album is one 
big indistinguishable track 
(with the occasional sad

you'll find yourself uninten-

AmI wrong in finding this so satisfactory -as background music? 
Tortoise try very hard to be 
artsy on the instrumental 
It's AU Arrnmd You, and it 
shows. But no matter how 
they work toward the reve-
latory or experimental (and 
succeed at it, subtly), their 
music doesn't come across 
as difficult or esoteric - it 
comes off merely as pleas-
ant. 

The band's latest effon 
is full of the usual mellow, 
post-rock experimentalism 
that Tortoise are lcnown for 
- so full, that it's hard to 
see how this latest release 
represents exploration of 
any new territory. But aside 
&om this criticism, there's 
nothing wrong with It's AU 
Arumd You. It's a color- and 
tenure-rich piece from 
beginning to end, &om the 
wordless electronic chorus 
of "The Lithium Stiffs" to

IS-minute opus of jazzy,

reminds why Tortoise have 
the reputati~ they do. The 
band can make interesting 
music out of a very simple

Tortoise claim lineage 
with the avant-garde jazz of 
the 19505, and for good 
reason. They're no Bird

LOTI: 
Relun ., tile II .. 

****, Starring Sean Astin, Orlando 
Bloom and Elijah Wood 

Truly, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy is the cinematic event of our generation. Three nearly flawless films are capped 
off by "The Return of the King," the best of 
the bunch. So why not give the nlm~ DVD 
release a perfect review? Sure, the third 
chaprer of the series contains enough bril~ 
liant writing, directir.g and acting to render 
discussion of disappointing DVD extras 
slightly poindess, but the simple fact that 
another DVD will be released by 
December with an extra hour of cut fontage 
maw this DVD release, well, slightly 
poindess. 

If you C2Il't wait to get your hands on the 
film (and who could blame you) or don't 
care about the extra footage, then this DVD 
is not a bad bet. The three-hour epic is 
housed 00 one disc, and it's easy to forget 
JUSt how much is crammed onto it. Frodo, 
Sam aDd Gollum deal with greed and 
betraf21 on their way to Mount Doom. 
Aragom steps into his role as the kin, of 
men while dealing with the affections 0 the 
lovely Arwen and Eowyo. Numerous other 
subplots develop featuring Pippin, Glmli, 
Legolas and the others. 

Even if you don't care lIbout elves and 
dwarves:, the batde scenes alone are beyond 
stunning - if ever there exisred an argu-
ment for the continued use of cG anima-
tion in film, this is it. Revisit me Batde of 
Pelenoor Fields (than "the big fight scene" 
to non~ToIkienite.s) to recall just how com-
pelling the 6ll1lll1lking is. Of course, the 
most impressive factor is seeing the fantas-
tical world J.RR Tolkien created come to 
life. Peter Jaclcson's brilliant directing, a 
powerful script and the focused acting of all 
the players (~cuJarly Sean Astin's rouch~ 
log portrayal of Sam and Andy Serlci$' bril~ 
Jiant voicing of the volatile Gollum) all con-
tribute to a faithful retelling of the story. 
Tolkien may have quipped at a change here 
or there, but overall, the heart of the story 
is preserved. 

A second disc contains the much-<:OJl-
tested special fearures section. 10 be fair, it's 
pretty loaded, exploring jackson's journey 
into creating the film as well as specific 
characters and elements of the stories. 
Although the interviews for many of the 
actors and creators are enjoyable, "The 
Quest Fulfilled" aDd "A Filmmaker's 
journey" features contain so much overl-ap-
ping content that they might as well be the 
same. A National Geographic special on the 
connections of the novels to history is a bet-
ter idea on paper than it is here, dragging 
with points that are either hi£hly debatable 
or not very interesting. Still, '!ollien enthu~ 
siasts should find plenty to appreciate here. 
So wb:at's the point in complaining when 
many will buy this DVD and the extended 
version? Is it possible that someone is prof-
iting a great deal and taking ad\'2ntage of 
fans by rdeasing different versions? You be 
the judge.

neG_ ... .... 
aldt ... ...., 

*** Starring dint Eastwood and 
Lee Van dee! 

Question: H a 1960s western that drags on for three hours, sports a 
shoestring budget that cut out dia-

logue and special effects to save filmmak-
ers' money, and features more cliches 
than a Treklcie convention is re-released 
as a collector's DVD, would college stu-
dents care? 

In an age where "action movie" means 
mul timillion-dollar explosions or another 
"Braveheart" battle epic, no. They 
should, however, because "The Good, 
the Bad and the Ugly" is a cinematic mas-
terpiece that rewards the audience for" 
keeping patient with director Sergio 
Leone's patented storyteUing sryle, a 
fresh combination of long, widescreen 
shots and quick, choppy zoomed shots 
and a fistful of action and plot twists 
along the way. 

Only a shred of humanity separates 
Clint Eastwood from "the Bad" (Lee 
Van Cleel) or "the Ugly" (Eli Wallach) 
- all three are vile creatures of the 
West pitted against one another in pur-
suit of a hidden Confederate treasure. 
They could scrap over it in brutal fash-
ion, but not before they are forced to 
cooperate in order to discover the gold's 
location: One knows the cemetery but 
not the grave, another the name on the 
headstone but not the cemetery, and all 
three know they will remain alive until 
the gold is found, but that they will like-
Iy fight to the death afterward. 

Quentin Tarantino called the film his 
all-time favorite, and it's easy to see the 
parallels in his techniques and Leone's: 
chatty, philosophizing killers, unortho-
dox revenge tactics, ironic situations of 
life and death, and even the trademark 
scene with everyone pointing a gun at 
someone else in the frame. 

The film will test viewers' patience 
with its long, drawn-out scenes, and 
there is by no means enough real plot to 
fill 180 minutes, but "The Good, the 
Bad and the Ugly" is full of character, 
grittiness and games Leone plays both 
vi sually and with dialogue to keep us 
interes ted. 

Audio commentary by Time maga-
zine critic Richard Schickel, a longtime 
Eastwood biographer, and the film's 
original Italian audio are play options 
that accompany the film on the first 
disc. The second is highlighted with 
two documentaries on the director -
"Leone's West" being the more inter-
esting - and a profile on Ennio 
Morricone, the composer who pro-
duced the score that has become syn-
onymolls with the film and facsimiled in 
pop culrure ever since. The extras are 
more than generous, but the abundance 
of features added onto a long-winded 
film like this is almost as over-the-top as 
the film itself.

***1 Starring Peter Weller and 
Nancy Allen 

Like any other product of the late '80s, "Robocop" has been deeply rooted as an object of modem collegiate nostal-
gia. As much as Bush Sr.-era sitcoms like 
"Mr. Belvedere," "The Wonder Years," 
"Family Matters" and "Saved By the Bell" 
offer gentle yuclcs and fond escapism for 
those just a little over 20, "Robocop" isn't 
quite how one might remember it. Its a 
given that the "part man, part machine, all 
cop" sports sleek, gleaming, bluish-tinged 
annor, twirls his gun in cowboy quick-
draw pastiche and offers the strangest 
monotone deadpan comic relief. 

Yet, with MGM's freshly reissued 
"RoOOcop: Trilogy" DVD set, it's strange 
to discover how spectacular "RoOOcop" 
acrually was. 

Aside from the crisp and vivid trans-
fers of all three discs, all but the first are 
virtually empty of any DVD extras. As 
there is not much to say about the latter 
two installations of "Robocop," it's not 
too disappointing. Yet, on the first, there 
is a veritable gold-mine of "RvOOcop" 
retrospective. The first disc, along with 
the original feature, includes a boisterous 
audio commentary from director Paul 
Verhoeven and producer jon Davison, 
several illuminating documentaries about 
the production and ideology of 
"RoOOcop," a few disappointing deleted 
scenes and the original trailers. 

Head and shoulders above the rest in 
appeal are the audio commentary and 
the documentaries. The first features 
the bantering, excited call-and-response 
arguments of Verhoeven and Davison, 
both of whom trade priceless anecdotes 
about the filming. Secondly, the fea-
turette documentaries are equally draw-
ing, as they explain the nuance and 
dogma behind the stoic-faced android. 
While it was superficially a glossy, sci-fi 
action flick, Verhoeven and writer 
Edward Neumeier recount the film as 
satire of Reagan-era politics, flourishing 
'80s "corporate American con-
sumerism," and perhaps even as an 
ultra-violent rendition of Jesus' resur-
rection. Also, check out the still pho-
tographs section for a classic snapshot 
of former President Richard Nixon 
posing with a faux "Robocop" at a Boys 
and Girls Club benefit. Pretty weird, 
no? 

So, what's so fantastic about this trilo-
gy? If just the first disc is worth its weight 
in cyborg steel, why waste an extra twen-
ty bucks on the lesser-quality, rehashed, 
and unwanted sequels? Why not just buy 
the "Criterion Collection" edition of 
"RoOOcop"? Well, if it turns out you can't 
wait for some cult-value ninja-and-jet-
pack "Robocop 3" action to air on the 
next local network's weekend movie fest, 
it just so happens that this collection is 
for you.

I asked a friend of mine what she thought of Hugh Jaclanan's lat-est fliclt, and to no surprise, she

--------------------------------------------- tlst I',orrls frull1 CU,lIcil,jl) CilllO • - ------------ --- --------- -----

It's impossible to write any sort of fa rewell to the Guardian withou t an intertwined sense of 
saying goodbye to UCSD. It's also 
impossible to try to think about 
what to write that could possibly 
be meaningful to anyone without 
slipping into well -worn cliches 
abom how much I've lea rned and 
how much I'll miss people. I have 
learned a lot, and I will miss peo-
ple very much. But it'd be great to 
write something mildly com-
pelling. I t'd be great to say some-
thing about the reason that jour-
nalism is the best thing that ever 
happened to me. 

Like a lot of editors on staff. 
r've been working on newspapers 
for a long ume. And like a lot of 
people who have worked on news-
paper' for a long time, I know 
about certatn indefatigable strug-
gles that all newspaper people 
have. There is never enough 
recognition for people who work 
really, really hard. There will 
always be someone willing to tell 
you that however hard yo u've 
worked, it isn't hard enough. And 
there will always be a story that 
could have been better, i rrespec-
tive of the interviews you gave, 
facts you dug up or time you 
spent . 

.. 0 why let it bother you so 
much?" I've heard people say, in 
response to my being hurt over a 
nasty post on the Web board or a 
particularly harsh letter to the edi-
tor. [n a way, this question and its 
variants are asked of journalists all 
the time and , in a way, the people 
asking these questions are right. 
With the rampam partisanship 
and slanted coverage that have 
come to exempli fy the media, it's 
hard to imagine why anyone 
would choose to care that much 
about something so riddled with 
problems, especially considering 
the aforementioned lack of recog-

Well , I've spem far tOO much newspri m rambl ing about causes at UCSD. I'd like, in 
any case, to spend my last few 
words in the Guardian thanlcing 
everyone I can remember in the 
past four years at UCSD who have 
either given an untested and arro-
gant undergraduate a crack at great 
opporrunities, have been interest-
ing people and valuable friends, or 
both. So without further ado, in 
the order I met them here:

landlord. Kristin Molle: Friend 
from high school, unimaginably 
happy person and high-tide mark. 

nition and not-uncommon lack of 
respect. 

And yet people do care. They 
care because they really love 
investigating and reporting and 
because they want to provide 
information for the people around 
them. And then there's the thrill of 
seeing your name in print, of see-
ing kids in class scan an article 
you've written. In those moments, 
it's easy to understand caring so 

Brian Daly: Gave me my first paid 
job, and sti ll working for under-
graduate scholarships. J ennifer 
Sposito (Copy 2000-01, Opinion

able three years of happiness, 
tears and maturation. Charlie 
Tran (Design 2000-0 I, Hiatus 
2001-02, Managing 2002-03): A

know and deserved my loyalty. 
Vince Gragnani (Chief 2000-01):

much about something that seems 
so rife with problems. In those 
moments, you are passing on your 
ideas to someone else, and that's 
kind of incredible. 

If I could have people take 
away one thing from reading my 
articles over the past three years, it 
would be, "Hey, this girl is really 
pas ionate about journalism."

Everything I really need to know, I learned in college. From Adrian, I learned 
how to argue. Ileamed that every-
thing ultimately comes down to 
semantics. I learned that intra-
European racism is just funny. 

From Alice, I learned that the 
best conversations cover everything 
from cute shoes to the Middle East 
peace process. I learned how beau-
tiful faith can be, and how much I 
wish I had some of it I learned that 
purses make the outfit. 

From Alison, I learned that 
every girl needs a friend who will 
say, "Just shut up and dump him." 
I learned that a roomful of friends 
and an oven full of cookies is pret-
ty close to heaven. I learned that a 
Hyundai smells terrible after two 
girls have lived in it for two humid 
weeks. 

From Arnon, I learned that love 
is most meaningful when it's 
stri pped of the need for possession. 
J learned that sometimes I just 
need to hear, "You're pretty, you're 
pretty, you're sexy, you're sexy." I 
learned that devil's horns plus plaid 
slcirt equals undefeatable power. 

From Bill, I learned that if you 
scratch a lush, you may find a 
prince. I learned to bet on low pairs 
and pray for the ace-king qualifier. 

From Brian, I learned that pas-
sion and sheer will are a magnet 
for lucl" I learned to stay away 
from Jacuzzis filled with exes. 

From Durango (Charlie,Jessa, 
Norris, Scott and Vince), I 
learned that a rum and coke 
makes a midterm that much easier 
to write. I learned that maybe my 
freshman-year roommate had rea-
son to flip out at me. I learned 
that if you're going to throw a 
party that almost gets you lcicked 
out of your house, you'd better 
make it so epic that you never 
even need to throw another one. 

From the GutmIUm, I learned 
that sometimes the windmills are 
worth 6ghting, and sometimes its 
better to lay down the lance and go 
home. I learned that thankless jobs 
don't always ennoble their partici-
pants. I learned that personal ful-
fillment is better than public 
acknowledgment. I learned how to 
do Sun God and how to love Vegas. 

From Jef, I learned that a 
friendship needs space to stay 
strong. I learned that my emo-
tional system is ratcheted a few 
degrees above everyone else's. I 
learned that no desire is more 
consuming than the desire for 
self-improvement. I learned that 
John Spreckles is behind every-
thing around here. 

From Jenny, I learned to have 
faith that if I reach out to some-
one, they'll reach back. I learned 
that Ludacris is one of the more 
entertaining social and economic 
commentaton of our time. 

From Josh, I learned that two 

unhappy people can fi nd 
moments of joy together, and 
that even those moments don 't 
amount to salvation. I learned 
the danger of taking one's identi -
ty for granted. ( learned that 
Shane Victorino is, in fact, a 
waste of human flesh . 

From Lauren, I learned that I 
don't have to keep bashing my 
head against the wall , waiting for 
my skull to get Strong enough to 
break through; instead, I can sim-
ply walk away. I learned that peo-
ple can work together for years 
and never know how alike they 
are. I learned that one should be 
sure to hide all permanent mark-
ers before getting drunk. 

From Matt, I learned that I 
already knew what makes me 
happy, and knew how to get it. I 
learned that the question, instead, 
was why I hadn't been doing that 
all along, and why] sti ll often fail 
to do it. ( learned that a lot can 
happen online. I learned the 
corollary to that: Emoticons are 
indispensable. 

From Rachel,llearned that the 
people who rock the most are 
often least aware of how much they 
rock. ( learned that Los Angeles 
isn't all bad. I learned how to fum 
any room into a dance club. 

From Rastin, (learned that love 
doesn't always come to those who 
deserve it. ( learned that the more 
ridiculous the bluff, the better the 
chance of success, Presumably, I 
will soon have learned how to tell 
good hip-hop from bad. 

From Russ, ] learned that 
while the past can't be forgotten, 
it can be forgiven . I learned that 
while such forgiveness is · hum-
bling, it's also profoundly reward-
ing. I learned that pineapple juice 
is the best chaser for tequila shots . 

From Sam, I learned that 
reminders of things I already 
know are very pmverful. (learned 
that all it takes for people to put 
up with me is an inability to read 
my tone of voice. J learned that 
beef is bad, and Mafia is good . 
Soon I'll learn calculus, right? 

From Sarah, I learned that one 
cannot overrate an unconditionally 
supportive friend. (learned that it 
is, apparently, possible to lenow half 
ofUCSD on a first-name basis. 

From Steve, I learned that love 
is sometimes best expressed 
through insults. I learned that I 
am a dirty Jew. 

From Sadie and Lilah, I learned 
that sanity sometimes comes from 
being driven completely nuts. I 
learned that family is more impor-
tant than adventure - or rather, 
that it is an adventure, though a 
less glamorous one than trekking 
across the Middle East. I learned 
that not only don't we raise no ugly 
children in this family, we don't

B12 SUMMERJGRAD SECTION

----~-- ----- ---

The great Jerry Seinfeld once aid that there was ju tone thing men think about: noth-
ing. We just like to walk around 
and check out "stuff. " This, ( 
believe, sums up my own experi-
ences in life, and at UCSD. There 
are too many rocks along the high-
way to Stop and sec them all -
your job is to find which ones are 
important to you, create your own 
landmarks, assess your happiness in 
the ituations that you find/find 
you, and always keep moving on 
down the road to ee more "stuff." 

Life is like a box of chocolates; 
you never know what you're going 
to get. Each opportunity at first 
glance looks just as delidous as the 

next, but you have to take the good 
with the bad, the sweet with the 
sour. 

To say there hasn 't been a 
healthy amount of the good, the 
bad and the ugly during my stay at 
UC5D and the GuardUm is dead 
wrong. And, with the u'tmost hon-
esty, 1 loved my experience at both. 

After the terrorist attacks of 
Sept. II, I had what the narrator of 
the stOry might call "an epiphany." 
It was clear to me that some 
acquaintances had absolutely no 
idea about our role in the world, or 
what was even going on outside of 
their respective social circles. This, 
more than anything, made mi! want 
to dedicate myself to journalism. 

---- --- - -

THE UCSD GUARDIAN 

People deserve to be provided with 
an understandable depiction of the 
world they live in, and ( have want-
ed to contribute positively to this 
fight for a better-informed public 
ever since. 

The logical step to take was to 
write for the school newspaper. I 
walked into the recruitment meet-
ing that fall looking for a pan-time 
gig as a news writer, and now r leave 
the editor in chief of the operation. 
In between then and now I have 
had the privilege of working with 
and learning from some of the 
finest individuals this school has to 
offer. We put out a \6- to 24-page 
body of work that involves a fulJ-
time business sta ff and dozens of 

Get it? I'm taking a bite out of a big apple? As in tht Big Apple? 
Truth be told, I have to be this 

flippant about my impending 
Oune 22) move to New York City. 

F~ppancy is my coping mecha-
Dlsm. 

I've got the obligatory "I heart 
NY" bag (which I know I'll only 
wear on the West Coast), r have 
learned how to hail a cab, and I 
know how not to get hopelessly 
lost on the subway. I'm fluent in 
the New York City vocabulary: I 
can even pronounce "Houston" 
and "Greenwich" correctly. All 
that stuff will be part of my regu-
lar day very soon and San Diego 
will be so last week. So, I'm flip-
pant about it. All of it. 

Effective in just a few days, this 
chapter is finished, folks. 

And the ending makes me want 
to cry. 

Four fleeting years ago, I was 
about to graduate high school and 
didn't feel like this. I was 17 years 
old and ready to go. I'd enjoyed my 
time, but for four years, I had 
worked to move out and move on. 
I did so with gusto. Now, four 
years later, I'm moving out and 
moving on, but this time, it's much 
different. 

As the days tick by and the day-
planner pages turn, I get exponen-
tially nostalgic. First, the really 
trivial: Every SO-cent bagel from 

Dawid lln8IGuanian 
your UCSD peers that don't get 
nearly enough recognition, com-
pensation or respect for the blood, 
sweat and tears they pour into every 
issue, 30 weeks a year. There is no 
"tabling" an issue for the next coun-
cil meeting because "The West 
Wing" is about to start. The 
Gtumlilm editors I know have sacri-
ficed everything short of life and 
limb to hold their end of the bar-
gain. 

My managing editors have 
brought so much more to our staff 
than I could ask for, and have pro-
vided the professionalism and tal-
ent needed to set the tone for the 
staff. To Jessica: The Star Jones fan 
club has never had a better presi-

the Co-op I eat could be my last. 
That fabulous, front-row parking 
space I got this morning is very 
likely the last. I knew I had a rag-
ing case of the nostalgia when I 
WIS grateful for my lper on 
Roman coinage since it made me 
take what might be my last trip to 
Geisel. 

Then there are the meaningful 
things that I mistook as trivial just 
six months ago. I now realize how 
much I will miss Greg snoring 
softly nen to me while I chat 
online with friends (my regular 
late-nirht AIM buddies: Rinaldo, 
EVan, Billy, Anne and Deena) deep 
into the night - even though I'm 
going to see them the nen day 
anyway. I'll miss Greg, my partner 
in crime for four years, calling my 
cell phone (I always know when 
it's him, even without looking at 
the nwnber) wondering when I'm 
coming home from a horrifically 
late night at work. I won't forget 
what it's like climbing into a warm 
bed after an 18-hour day. It's truly 
painful to know I won't have that 
every night for (at most) two 
years. 

Remember the crying thing? 
Yeah, me too. I typically don't do 
it often - if ever - but now, with 
just words left of this chapter, I 
feel the emotion all the time. And 
it\ strong. Even in the very public 
Balboa Park; with Greg and th~ 
ever-precious puppy Sir Wmston,

dent. Thank you so much for your 
support over the last year. Your 
courtesy and friendship has made 
coming to worlc. something to look 
forward to. Somehow I convinced 
you to run for managing editor on 
Hour Six of Sun God last year, and 
I'm very thankfu1 that you gave it a 
shot, this year would not have been 
the same otherwise. 

Clayton Valentine Worfolk: 
Disco Stu called, he wants his wig 
back. You've been a great partner 
in crime when you haven't been 
running around with the GOP. 
Thanks for keeping a fresh per-
spective on things this year. Next 
year wilJ require plenty of patience 
and an abundance of energy. Your 
aim is true and the staff respects 
that. Keep your cool next year and 
you'll have a great time. 

Section eds: Blade, you're Bryan 
Fellows crazy. You mean shenani-
gans? Gaelle: The news section is 
everything I wanted it to be; now 
finish your sandwich. Gov. Watts: 
God bless the city, state or nation 
that elects you into office. Thank 
you for challenging my ideas and 
making me think this year. Anne: 
Hiarus rocks and, you're right, men 
are scum. Hot shot: messing up your 
trademark hair arrangement should 
be on the agenda of every editorial 
board meeting. Karla : reach-
arounds? Mather: wink, wink, Luke 
Perry is a loser. Rachel : Thanks for 
making me into the union buster I 
always dreamed of being. Ed, Ed, 
Ed, Ed: Your unofficial help this year 
is very much appreciated. I'm very 
grateful you came back this year to 
help. To the associates and other 
staffers I've been in contact with: 
Space limits are space limits, but I 
want to express my gratirude for 
your very hard work. 

Most importantly, withollt the 
support of a caring and providing 
family and the greatest friends a 
guy could ask for, I would never 
have been able to keep my head. 
Mom and Dad, I love you very 
much. To Harlan 224, the Five-

to the outside world I'm an inex-
plicable and inexcusable mess. 

But, to me at least (and I know 
Greg gets it), it's undcntandable. 
I've had a good ride. 

I learned hOw to thinIC objec-
tively about the world, people, 
myself. Other than all those facts 
and theories I've lived and 
breathed in four yean worth of 
communication, political science 
and visual arts classes, a few pro-
fessors taught me how to think. 

I built a connection to this 
school this year, so different from 
my first three years when I suc-
cessfully used UCSD only for lec-
tures. Evan, I thank you from the 
bottom of my heart for giving me 
the opportunity to do that. Had 
you not convinced me to become 
more involved with this newspa-
per, I would have just ... graduat-
ed. I wouldn't have had this send-
ott. "UCSD" means much more to 
me than "Peterson 110" now. 

I had a mentor. John Shore 
took me under his wing, taught 
me more than he will ever know 
and gave me the magnificent 
opportunity to help him build a 
magazine. John taught me that 
there is always more to learn. 
Look for his name and book on a 
forthcoming bestseller list. 

I started to know my parents as 
friends and realized what a stroke 

TIiURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2004 

When you only have 36 frames to te II the story, every time the shutter 
clicks anything that can be done 
afterward is not worth considera-
tion, and you move on to the next 
possible thousand-word opportu-
nity. In photojournalism, you 
learn to move on, and you move 
on with the pace of the event 
unfolding. Some assignments have 
been boring, others quite the 
opposite, but with every assign-
ment I've taken, the chance to 
learn something new has always 
been there. For the past year, I've 
felt as if I were Peter 
Parker/Spider-Man, running all 
over the place photographing 
assignments, while juggling 
schoolwork and just life as a 
whole. 

It's kind of funny to see the edi-
tor in chief come down on photog-
raphers one day, as James Jonah 
Jameson does to Peter Parker, but 
that was a very rare occurrence. As 
a result of my running ali over the 
place, I will receive a degree in 
lCAM (interdisciplinary comput-
ing and the arts) and a degree in 
communication, as well as a minor 
in photography all within the span 
of a surprisingly short foUT years. I 
only minored in photography 
because it allows me to just take the 
courses about phlltography and not 
unnecessary ones su(.h as script 
writing. I'm still trying to figure 
out a way to combine the three 
fields, bur I will· always have a pas-
sion for photography and digital 
art. 

I'm a relative rookie compared 
to the others here that have 
worked at the GUllrdilln for almost 
their entire college lives. 

I staned our in October of this 
school year and soon became asso-
ciate photo editor a month after 
being hired. I came in knowing 
nobody and nothing about the 
G1UI1'dwn, but wiIJ end up taking 
everything I've learned from 
being there . Rachel, the photo 
editor, had big plans for the photo 
department but needed a second 
hand in implementing the 
changes, and I'm glad I was cho-
sen to help see most of those 
changes go through. 

On occasion, I would have to 
take a step up from my associate 
duties and make decisions 
assigned for the photo editor. 
However, it has always been great 
interacting with the delightful 
crew of the editors and designers. 
Working with Photoshop for 
years has allowed the worldlow of 
adjusting photos to be fast-paced, 
which I've always enjoyed. I've 
tried my best to be reliable for the 
GfUlriJilln, be it receiving calls 
when Rachel was gone, making 
final crops or taking last-minute 
assignments. As one of my photo 
professors said numerous times 
before, reliability is a necessary 
characteristic to have in life after 
college. Unfortunately, I'm not 
on time. 

All but two of the senior send-
off photos were shot in digital 
with a Canon Digital Rebel and a 
Nikon DIX: We were fortunate to 
have access to this expensive 
equipment, but I decided to go 
the traditional route and have my 
portrait shot on film. I know that 
digital photography is made for 
the field of photojournalism, but 
there was a time when film wa 
u ed, and r truly admire those 
great photographers of the past. 

Photos this year have been 
amazing. The photographers that 
I work alongside hav hown their 
strength while working on their-
weaknesse . I've always enjoyed 
coming in on Sunday and 
Wednesday, being bombarded by 
Sports, Features, Hiatus and 
News for photo. 

However, the staff of the 
GUllrdilln, some of whom I've 
become good friend with, have 
been great, even with their quirks. 
Their faces I will forever remem-
ber, but if I ever forget, they will 
only be a memory away. Make that 
a photograph away. 

Henri Cartier-Bresson once 
said, "To take photographs means 
to recognize - simultaneously 
and within a fraction of a second 
- both the fact itself and the rig-
orous organization of visually 
perceived forms that give it 
meaning. It is putting one's head, 
one's eye and one's heart on the 
same axis."

This poem is the only worth-

while thing I gOt out of 
Introduction to Poetry. And yes, 
I have a bit of a Lois Lane com-
plex. But, lilc.e her, I must say 
goodbye, because I can't stand 
here while the world rushes past. 
[ am off to find adventure and it 
looks like I'm doing that on my 
own. But before I go, 1 have a 
lew words to say. 

I'm the typical over-acbiev-
ing oldest child, always have 
been. I'm graduating after only 
three years, mostly because I was 
the same freak in high school 
and took every AP class in sight. 
But as each day flies by in a flur-
ry of paper-writing and continu-
JUS procrastination, I start to 
wish I had more time. 

I continually am getting the 
feeling that I am just too young 
for all this, whether it be going 
to Porter's Pub with my group 
from class and remaining the 
only one without a beer or when 
I am strongly tempted to take 
up that internship with the 
Oscar Meyer Wienermobile this 
summer. I really think my dis-
gust as a vegetarian over hawk-
ing meat products to small chil-
dren would be nullified by the 
twenty versions of the Oscar 
Meyer wiener song, including 
Cajun and Spanish! 

I've had my share of good 
times and shenanigans, and I am 
so glad I chose to come to 
UCSD. In bet, UCSD was my 
first choice - for real. And no it 
is not because that was all I 
could get into, because I got into 
Berkeley and turned them down. 
We live by the beach, people! 
San Diego has about a million 
things to do if you get off cam-
pus once in a while! Quit your 
complaining! 

It would be wrong to say that 
all I got from the GuardUm was a 
line on my resume and a disturb-
ing nickname (by the way 
Rinaldo, the answer is yes). As a 
girl who was reading every book I 
could find about Nelly Bly, the 
first newspaperwoman, at the 
tender age of ten, this place has 
been my dorlty journalistic solace. 

I realize my shy quiemess 
may hive been mistaken for dis-
interest, but I want you to know 
that I am so grateful to have 
found you guys. 

From the moment I walked 
into the production room, r 
knew I was home. It still is a lit-

next to the crossword puzzle. 
Yeah, I'm sorry clue 38-across

I was worried to go into this

ter when I've been overwhelmed. 
To Anne, Deena and Billy, it was 
nice to share the office with you 
guys. You brought Johnny Depp 
and constant comedy into my life 
during my office hours. Deena, 
we will always have "The O.C.; 
which is a good show no matter 
what anyone says! 

Evan, I will always remember 
being doped up on cold medi-
cine and playing blackjack after a 
nine-hour drive. 

Neha, my honorary sister. 
Thanks for aU the help and for 
being there for me both as an 
associate and a friend. It isn't 
every day you stumble upon 
someone that brings so much 
sunshine into your life, but I'm 
glad that I did. I will miss all the 
good times with the editors this 
year, but since I set the space 
limit, I better sticlc. to it. 

To the snarlty wenches I live 
with, I don't know what I'm 
going to do without you guys. 

~ A. CiaKia and o.Md Ung/Cuardion 
Katherine, no one appreciates a 
good banana-cream pie quite 
like you. Thanks for listening 
and making 'me come out of my 
shell once and a while. I will 
dance on a box for you anytime. 
Beware the manwhores . 

Natalie, how did the planets 
align to give us such :l perfect fit 
with a random fifth roommate? 
Your sarcasm and delightfully 
bad storytelling abilities will be 
desperately missed. It is rare to 
find someone as dorky as myself, 
but Natabat, you are it. Jenny, 
your talent for animal noises is 
unparalleled. I'm glad all that 
exercising gives you the endor-
phins to keep you smiling, 
because no one peps up a crowd 
like a kid who's been to leader-
ship camp. Kimberly, I know I 
sound like your grandmother 
calling you that, but too bad. 
Seriously though, you should 
always remember who made you 
try out for "Wheel of Fortune" 
as you are blowing your thou-
sands on Lil' Homies. Think 
NBC will give you the money in 
quarters? 

To all my boys in the dorms: 
Nicholas, we've been together 
since the first graae (more or 
less), and while it was fun being 
lonely Ramona kids all the time, 
I'm glad we actually did make 
some friends. Will , I know you 
plan to move to China and never 
talk to us again, but we'll always 
have X-Mas Rave Fever. Robin, 
you are adorably goofy and per-
haps the smartest guy [ know. 

Thanks for pointing out 
every single thing wrong with 
the GUllrtiilln and at least reading 
some of my articles. Bryan, we 
are the least-Iilc.ely pair, but 
somehow it works. I'm glad you 
didn't make good on your 
promise to move back to Santee 
and never realJy talk to us again. 
Dad, Mom and the siblings, you 
are always there for me and the 
indentured servitude hasn't been 
so bad.

814 SUMMER/GRAD SECTION THE UCSD OUAJlDlAN THURSDAY, JUNE 3, 2004 

--- - --=-------~~--~--- - ---

GlIIJrtUII1I and at UCSD - a rather 
unusualleaming experience. 

Without a doubt, some of my 
most indelible memories have 
occurred on the infamous GtulrtJUm 
Vegas trips. Every year, typically 
during the Martin Luther King, Jr., 
three-day weekend in January, brave 
adventurers pile into their fellow 

Guardianite~ vehicle, pray their con-
veyance will reach that bright city of 
sin, and once they reach their desti-
nation, the next two days become 
hazy memories of drunlcen debauch-
ery, cheap indigestion-inducing 
food, and memorable late-night con-
versa tions. 

....................... 

This past February, I went on 
my final GrumJUm Vegas trip and it 
was, shaJJ I say, unforgettable. I got 
to see the Hiatus crew - Billy, 
Deena, Rinaldo, Jessica, Clayton (l 
don't care, you're all Hiatus at 
heart) - of crazy, brilliant little 
rascals in a new light that will most 
likely always stay with me. Billy, 
!Uchel and I shared an adventure 
when we had Viemamese food in 
Temecula and ate frog legs. Sitting 
beside Billy in his white Jeep for 
five hours while he burped up frog 
legs (he was lcind enough to roll 
down the windows each time he 

" Without a doubt, some of 
my most indelible memo, 
Ties have occurred on the 

who got drunk and blew alcoholic 
burps into other people's faces. 
Ahem. 

Which reminds me ... 
It will be so strange after the 

school year is over. I won't haft 
production on Tuesday nights any-
more. Deena will never be sitting at 
the computer, reading news Web 
sites and telling us about random 
stories that we don't really pay 
attention to. Jessica won't be mak-
ing exclamations about whatever 
Deena said. Billy won't be stealing 
food out of my hands as we work. 
And Evan won't be malcing wise-ass 
comments on the reads. How sad it 
will all be when we all move onto 
life after college. 

I n writing this, 1 know only one thing for sure: Regardless of what I write, the next time I see this, 
whether it is in 10 days or 10 years, I 
will of course shudder and deny ever 
having written it. To make this as 
painless as possible, I'll just remi-
nisce over some of my memora ble 
experiences. Hey, maybe someone 
else can gel a kick out of this. 

Well, one Thursday evening, 
about four years ago, a small, soft-
spoken freshman timidly walked into 
the GUll1'Iwm offices for her first 
Hiatus meeting. lbat freshman was 
me, and that was the night that 
changed my life forever ... OK, I'm 
being dramatic, and anyone who 
knows me knows that I am mvtr dra-

matic, but it really was an interesting 
night. Dave Lee, the Hiatus editor at 
the time, lounged over the wooden 
armrests of the tattered, '70s-era 
chair, spealcing calmly until he got to

My sophomore year, the car I 
traveled with almost didn't malce it. 
As I sat in the baclc seat of a putter-
ing vehicle that belonged to a fellow 
Hiatus writer with an editor and a 
photographer, I sat in near horror as 
I could feel the car around me choke, 
lurch and slowly die as we made our 
way to the right shoulder of the 1-15. 
We had only traftled one hour and 
were stranded outside of Temecula. 
So we abandoned the car at Pep 
Boys and ended up back in San 
Diego for the night. 

But we were not deterred! We 
would make it to Vegas! So after an 
uncomfortable night of warding off 
an icky unwanted spooner on a 
lumpy fold-out sob bed, we all piled 
into a little Hyundai determined to 
make it to Vegas. And we did it! That 
night I wandered through the &ncy 
hotels till the wee hours of the 
morning with people I had never 
met before talking about random 
things I thought were brilliant at the 
time, while others became inebriat-
ed, hooked up and created drama. 
Good times.

Vegas trips." 

did) was a highlight of that trip. In 
those fi ve hours though, I actuall y 
learned something: I like Teenage 
Fan Club. Every, "Who is this? 
They're really good," was always 
followed by, "Uh, it's still Teenage 
Fan Club." And how about when 
we actually reached Vegas? What 
fun! I had free drinks while playing 
video blackjack at a bar with 
Rachel, and then I took a drag of 
my fint cigarette (yeah, yeah, don't 
say it) and made the insightful com-
ment, "Hmm '" it tastes lilce barbe-
cue." Thanks to Billy, I'll never lift 
that down. But I wasn't the one 

When I started on the 
Gua,.dilln, the paper was certainly 
not like it is now. Evan has done 
quite a job of ending the drama 
that had continually hung over the 
office, and what a relief that has 
been. No more of that incestuous 
dating and interdating like had 
gone on between editors and sec-
tion heads. None of that .. , wait, 
there's still some rivalry and ill-
feelings of sorts, but miracles can't 
be expected. AlII know is that this 
year has been one with its trials, 
tribulations, good times and great 
memories. 

I've learned a lot from worlcing 
at the GlI4rtlill" these past years. 
!t's hard to put into words. The 
G,umJum has been more than just 
a student-run paper, and these 
past four yean have been a lot 
more than just classes and eums. 
I'll just stop here before I get any 
more nostalgic or sappy. It's been 
fun, we're done and I'll miss you 
all! 

On June 13 , 2000, I crossed the stage at the Regcncy Hotel to receive my diplo-ma from the American School of 
Kuwait. 

Four years later, I will cross the stage on 
RIMAC field to r~(.eive my bachelors of arts 
in communication from the University of 
California, San Diego. 

As the G rateful Dead said, "What a long, 
strange trip it's been." 

In the four years since crossing that stage 
a million miles from here, life has taken unex-
pected twists and turns. Completely up and 
moving across the world affects you in ways I 
never would have imagined. During these 
four years, I've come across people that I'm 
thanlcful to have met. That's not to say that 
I'm going to miss everyone. On the contrary, 
there are many that I'm thankful to leave 
behind. But every person you meet along the 
way gives you something that helps shape 
who you become. The awful roommate helps 
you realize exactly what lcind of person you 
Jq,,'t want to be. The stuck-up people who 
think that their taste is better than your taste 
- for the record: No one cares. 

Despite the bitterness, not everyone I've 
encountered has been negative. There are 
the bright, vivacious people who helped you 

-------~~ - -- -- - -

develop. They've helped you change, let you 
change. They're the beSt friends that remain 
from high school who you've essentially 
grown up with. They're the new friends you 
make when you get to a new place. They're 
the people who replace the psychotic room-
mate of yore and malce you thinle, uI guess 
roommates aren't that bad, eh?" And, most 
importantly, they're parents who guide you, 
no matter how frustrating their decisions 
may seem. Every person you meet helps 
shape you, for better or for worse. 

Just like high school, these last few weelcs 
make it seem like everything is a "last": UOh 
my god, its the last time we'll ever have 
finals!n "Dh my god, its the last time I'll get a 
ticket because my meter ran out while I was at 
my three-hour class!" UOh my god, it's the last 
time I'll slOp my really boring history class!" 
UOh my god, it's the last time we'll grab a 50-
cent bagel at the Co-op!" Doing a final pro-
ject on my home away from home, the Old 
Student Center has increased the "last-thing" 
feeling during this past week. All that~ need-
ed is a sing-song voiceover and H&H playing 
guitar and the tears will be complete. Ob, 
wai t, we were tallcing about tears of sadness. 

See DEENA. Page BIS 

I still am not really sure how I ended up here. As early as two years ago, I couldn't have guessed I'd be here. Yet here I am, 
completing my tenure as an associate editor 
at the GUilrdilln. For being somewhat of a 
late addition, the GUIIf'dill1J has come to be an 
incredibly :mportant pan of my life. 

Unlike those who started at the paper 
their freshman year and continued on, my 
time at UCSD can be divided roughly in half 
between pre- and post-G1UmJiIl1l indoctrina-
tion. It started at the beginning of my junior 
year when I decided to chanJe majors out of 
sheer boredom with psychofosy and a clear 
fixation on my writing minor. I knew I loved 
writing and music. Hmm, logical next step? 

I can't remember if I thought to seek out 
the Guardill1l on my own or in .. w a flyer or 
what, but I soon found myself writins for 
the Hiatus section just about every week, 
usually about music. My only rep is DOt 
having started sooner; it ... such. clear fit 
for me that I decided I wanted to do it for 
the rest of my life or die trying (hopefully 
the former). 

Once I got serious about writing, it made 
sense to apply for editor. The best part of my 
interview was a questioo Iddnm d to RiDIlcIo 
by another editor: Has Billy eva' hid ...... 

lem with deadlines or lateness? Jesus, here was 
going to be my downfall. Me, who is known by 
all for my perpetual lateness (we call it Cuban 
time). Well I guess I haft Rinaldo~ trusty for-
getflll noggin to thank for saying NNo.n See, 
Rinaldo's good for more than just scaring peo-
ple and killing conversations. 

As an editor, I wanted Hiatus to be well-
rounded and give attention to things rarely 
seen in mainstream media. Namely, I wanted 
to focus on independent film and music, as 
well as events specific to San Diego. I never 
lcidded myself into thinking I didn't hm: a 
bias, but I think it is gmuinely important to 
seek out art in whateftr context )'0lIl' interest 
lies. So whett people would say, "I don't know 
any of the bands you guys WIt a60ut in the 
GwmIiim," how should I respond to that? 
Switch to reviewing P. Diddy and Linkin 
Park? It's not as if I hate all pop music, but 
whan the point? You can read certain other 
publications to get the latest on the feud 
between HiJary Duff and AmI Lavigne .. 

With so much pat IIlUIic available in 
San Diego alone, I IDIde it my job to keep up 
on such thinp. Sure,_ everything on the 
radio sucks due to FCC regulations being

Deena: Goodbye bagels, 
goodbye tofurkey 

continued from PtJ&e B I 4 
at my fingertips. There have been 
the trips (Monica'S trip to San 
Diego, the infamous Grurtlill1l trip 
to Vegas and my own trip to 
Tennessee); my first (and probably 
last) game of sloshball; my last Sun 
God (which, coincidentally, was 
also the lamest Sun God. Busta, 
shut up); starting (and finishing) a 
SO-page thesis. But now, as I face 
entering into the real world, I real-
ize that the world is so much bigger 
than I thought it would be. 

As I head out to find a job, there 
are things that I'll miss that are so 
trivial : The aforementioned 50-
cent bagels are likely to be what I'll 
miss most about UCSD. 
Complaining about this to my 
mom resulted in an eye-roll (or, at 
least I assumed she did; I was t2lk-
ing to her on the phone) and the 
comment that I can find the same 
thing in other places. But the Co-
op is a special place near and dear 
to my heart and stomach. Where 
else can I get a bagel with tofurkey 
& Monterey J lick cheese and have it 
come out to 51.61? Nowhere, I'll 
tell you that. Of course, I'll miss the 
campus and the feel of college, but 
the bagels are key. Goodbye, 
bagels! I'll miss you most of all. 

As &r as life after college, the fmt 
winter without winter break? That'll 
be hard. The flexible schedule (only 
Tuesdayffiursday cl.wes 5 awe-
some)? Gone. The ability to head to 
class in my scruffy clothes will be 
replaced by being forced to wear 
nice clothes and put on my face. And 
I'm sure I'll miss the ability to take a 
nap whenever I want during the day. 
On the upside, I have these glorious 
&ntasies ofleaving my work lit work. 
No more staying up all night to bang 
out the rest of my senior thesis, oil 
no. Work win be at work. Home will 
be the place for the TIvo and sleep. 

But leaving the trivial aside, the 
most important thing I've learned is 
that individualism is Ur. There will 
always be those who try to make 

you feel that you're less than what 
you are, because of 'Who you are. 
Their own insecurities get passed 
onto you. I've even kept such a per-
son in my life under the pretext of 
friendship. It's not worth it to keep 
these people in your life. The most 
important thing is to not let other 
people change who you are. Of 
course, they should influence you 
and help you grow, but changing 
who you inherently are isn't the way 
to go about it. Stand firm in your 
beliefs and St2y true to who you are. 

But I'll end this with a &rewell to 
the friends I've made at the GtunrIitm 
this year, in hierarchical order. First, 

there~ Ms. Jess'ca, with whom I've 
spent many a night tallcing on AIM, 
bitching about people with butts for 
&ces and the two-for-one video pro-
duction deals, and who has also 
many times taken and piclced me up 
from various transportation locaJes. 
Thanks for sharing classes with me; 
otherwise I seriously would have had 
to walk out alone every day. Then 
there's Anne, and while we've had 
our ups and downs, it~ been interest-
ing getting to know you throughout 
the past two years. You will do awe-
some in Guadalajara. Ab, Billy. With 
your ro, ro mit brontosaurus T-shirt, 
your help in refining my music tastes 
(the world thanks you) and your con-
stant puns and pll.llings-of-the-6nger 
will always stay with me. 
Northwestern's lucIcy to have yo'_, 
dude. I mean, Dad. And, since I'm 
running out of space, I'll just say that 
T loved everyone on st2ff this year. 
YOII all rocked. Special honorable 
mention to Rinaldo. 
. . To the new staff: Take care and 

godspeed. Ian, Sarah and Neha, I 
have the utmost &ith in you to keep 
the section going in fine Hiatus tra-
dition. 

In ULost in Translation,~ Bill 
Marray said that "the more you 
know about who you are and what 
you want, the less you let things 
upset you." I wish all of you the 
success you deserve. 

Evan: Outgoing editor in 
chief hangs up ·his gloves

meaning of "round trip": You have 
been my brothers for the past four 
years and college will be synony-
mous with your friendship. This 
summer is the last hurrah in San 
Diego before I depart for 
Washington, D.C., and points 
beyond, while the rest of you go 
your separate ways - let's maIce it 
count. 

Mark Twain said, "Don't let 
school interfere with your educa-
tion." UCSD is not going to blud-
geon its student body with the 
eJCitement stick anytime soon, but 
don't let that get you down. Some 
schools, for inst2nce, will have 
commencement speaken who are 
seasoned in life and possess enough 
minor celebrity to make a lasting 
impression upon the graduates, a 

little more prestigious than "the 
girl my roommate hooked up with 
freshman year. n 

You will be the only one capable 
of motivating yourself to sift 
through the bureaucracy and bull-
shit that has bogged many poor 
souls down in the apathy and stress 
connotations of UCSD. Find a few 
professors that make it worthwhile, 
visit their office hours, and allow 
them to challenge you intellectually. 
For me, Michael Schudson, Sean 
Smith, Dan Hallin and Michael 
Bernstein were professors whose 
efforts and advice inspired me to 
learn outside the syllabi, and I am 
indebted to them. 

The world has its share of skep-
tics who will doubt you and your 
dreams; you don't need to be part 
of that company. Keep on truclcin'. 

Claire: Many valuable 
lessons learned 

coruinI4d from ". B 10 
raise no stupid ones, neither. 

From Chuck, I learned that 
"£ather" doesn't have to be a dirty 
word. I learned that f3mily isn't 
about blood or even circumstance: 
family is a choice and a process. I 
learned how to tell how much 
money a man makes just by loolrln, 
at his watch. 

And from Mom, most of all 
Mom, always Mom. I learned that 
all we haw to steer us in this crazy 
life is the SlIDe few pieces of wis-
dom, and all we're called upon to 
do is pISS thbse pieces around. I 
learned dlat while I can tolerate my 

own misery, I cannot bear to see 
others distraught because I'm 
unhappy. 

I learned that family is a shelter 
and a slap in the face, whichever 
you need more at the moment. I 
learned that being a good mother 
doesn't mean never being driven to 
tears or rash words by YOlD' chil-
dren: It means siving your children 
the chance to become who they 
want to be. 

So thanks, UCSD, for making 
this fine education possible. And 
thanks for the book-Ieamin', too. If 
it comes in handy someday, I'll let 
you know.

who also gave me his driver's 
license for Vegas (with which I 
lost 5200). Isaac Pearlman (Sports

Brilliant physics major who I fully

while stealing someone elsc's 
food. Matt Schuerman: The most 
modest physics major who has

he's far more hard-working and 
intelligent than one of us who is 
far too self-flattering for h is own

You can only really complai. if 
you aren't paying attention. 1 ot 
everyone has to be a geek, but as 
corny as it sounds, if I turn a per-

they'd never considered before, 

it~ more than enough for me. 
But enough about the music. I 

want to thank everyone at the 
G".,.dUm for putting up with my 
nonsense and letting me do what I 
love. Productions never felt lilce 
work, listening to Grant's non 
sequiturs and writing down when 
Deena says things like "cock" out 
of conten. Going to Vegas with 
the G was one of the most fun 
times I had ever had. I can safely 
say I've never before or since been 
to a sex shop, a go-kart track and 
in a stretch limo in the same 
night. My other favorite GlUlrditm 
memory: Learning I got into 
journalism school at 

Northwestern and having the 
other editors be more excited 
than T was, toasting with cheap 
wine in paper cups during late-
night production. That meant a 
lot. That, and Evan trying to open 
the bottle by slamming it into the 
office wall with a hoe and dent-
ing it in the process. 

Anne and Deena, you guys rule 
so hard. Anne, I don't know how 
you could keep us in line so well 
and stay so sweet, but you man-
aged. Also you have a huge-ass tat-
too on your bade, and I think that's 
awesome. Deena, you are one of 
the most fun people to be around 
that I know. 

Management, you guys never 
&iled to impress me. Evan, you're 
the most kick-ass editor in chiefl've 
ever had. Clayton, if your skills as 
managing editor are an indication, 
you're going to do amazingly nen 
year. Jessica, you fine, foxy redhead, 
you're going to me Oftr New York 
just like the Olsens did. You're real-
ly too nice to me, but I appreciate 
when you compliment my writing 

and make my ego swell beyond 
healthy proportions. 

Hiatus kids, you rock my world. 
Thanks for indulging us even when 
we wanted you to review some 
lame movie or band no one wanted 
to do. Anna, Richie, Jessica, Ann, 
thanlcs so much , you don't know 
how hard Ollr decision was. Ian, 
Neha and Sarah, yOllr enthusiasm 
and camaraderie is so inspiring ~o 
us. But mow you have a tough job 
to do - we've got the best section, 
and J know it'll stay that way with 
you guys. 

That was some sappy shiL

of luck it was that I have these 
two people in my life . I aspire to 
be as compassionate, loyal and 
selfless as my mom. I learned how 
to think big, above and beyond 
what everyone expects, from my 
dad. 

I learned to appreciate indi-
viduals, apart from their age, 
work and persona. I am so proud 
of my brother Jeff, on a full foot-
ball scholarahip at Oregon, but 
appreciate him aide from his 
sport. He's SO much more than a 
football player, and I hope he 
never forgets that. My other 
brother David is eight yean old, 
but he's cooler than I am. 
Through him, I met my parents 
u people. 

Through all of it, the ups and 

downs, late nights and a11-
nighters, Greg has been there. 
He taught me to be introspective, 
be realistic about who I am and 
what I'm doing and kept me 
grounded and loved, even at my 
weakest and worst. From him, 
I've learned that no matter how 
independent I thinle I am - or 
try to act - I need people in my 
life I can lean on. As a person who 
wanted to trudge through the 
world on my own, it was a hard 
lesson. 

But I learned, and it was not 
easy; it~ the only way I can move 
across country. Even though they 
are thousands of miles away, I 
have people in my life I recognize 
that I need and trust. I know they 
will be there for me. I hope they 
know I will always be there for 

them. 
As for all my important 

GUllrdiall people, I'm here any-
time - an e-mail, phone call, 
plane ride away. Clayton, I'm 
proud already. Evan, even though 
YOIl are a "party guy," I respect 
the hell Ollt of you. Deena, con-
tinue to paint the world. Anne 
and Billy, whenever I see Naked 
Cowboy in Times Square, I'll 
thinlc of you two. Rinaldo, go in 
peace and I look forward to your 
letter from the bush every so 
often (innuendo intended). 

I suppose my fortune for your 
cookie is to not let UCSD slip 
through your fingers; get a men-
tor, pronto, and meet your family 
as people. For all you indepen-
dents out there, open up. It's 
worth it.

BI6 SUMMERJGRAD SECTION ruE UCSD GUARDIAN 

Wong Fu cheers campus 
Music videos gain national fame 

IyIHUIWU 
Staff lMiter 

Posts of admiration and appreci-
ation always seem to fill the guest 
book of student-run Web site 
Wongfuproductions.com, a site fea-
turing creative, entertaining music 
videos set on the UCSD campus. 
The site has been growing in popu-
larity becuase of its originality and 
innovation in making music videos. 
It now has a fan base spanning the 
United States, as well as six conti-
nents. 

It all began when Revelle 
College sophomore Philip Wang 
got together with suitemates Brett 
Yokota, Matthew Cheung, Clark 
Chen, Ryan Okada and Frank Chiu 
to form Wong Fu Productions. 
Wang directed, choreographed and 
edited the first music video that the 
group brainstormed together, 
which was performed to "Senorita" 
by Justin TImberlake. 

"We made the music video 
because Phil was playing the song 
50 times a day, and we figured that 
if we let him make a music video, it 
would shut him up," according to 
the site. "Our main reason is to put 
a smile on everyone's faces and 
hopefully make someone's day." 

The aptly-named Ultra Cool 
Sexy Dudes were on a roll, releasing 
a second video six months later to 
the theme song of the Chinese soap 
opera "Meteor Garden." 

" One of my favorite shots would 
have to be of my suitemate Andy 
Carroll singing to Chinese music he 
coul d not understan d in our second 
video," Wang said. 

Favorite memories also include 
the weird looks received from 
passersby while scenes were being

filmed. There were also the nights 
during finals week after the second 
video was released when they stayed 
up until 3 a.m. every night. 

"We were checking stats for the 
site, just thinlcing about it," Wang 
said. "We knew we should be study-
ing, but they were looking at us 
from Harvard, from Denmark. We 
stayed up till 3 a.m., 4 a.m. the 
whole week." 

Wang estimates that people 
from about 30 different countries 
have visited the site, including pe0-
ple from Israel, South Africa, 
Britain, France, Brazil and 
Australia, where they reportedly 
have a lot of fans. 

"I really have no idea how 
because we just gave the links to a 
few friends, and people just passed it 
along, ] guess," Wang said. "We 
never advertised or tried to push 
our site." 

Fans Jre requesting posters and 
T-shirts, but Wang doesnt want it 
to get too famous. "I think this is 
just something for fun", Wang said. 
"We're not trying to get famous for 
it. We're not trying to get populari-
ty out of it, not trying to get an ego 
boost or anything. 1 just want to 
make people happy, make people 
smile. We're just trying to enjoy 
ourselves, trying to have fun at UC 
San Diego. People make it seem 
like we're celebrities, but we're real-
ly not. We're just normal college 
kids." 

Evidence of the growing popu-
larity of Wong Fu Production's 
videos is plentiful in its forum and 
guest book, where fans from Santa 
Cruz, Calif., New York University 
and even Toronto thank the group 
for brightening up their days. 

"We get e-mails from high 

~:~~~IF/SAN, DIEGO H Q CI) 
H 
~ REAL WOR . -8ft . LO 
fJ ONE WAY ' 

school kids saying they want to 
come here beause the campus 
looks really nice," Wang said. 
"UCSD students give us props for 
malcing it look like a great place, 
and people from other schools have 
actually told us they want to transfer 
here after seeing some of the videos. 
We're just trying to represent. I 
have a lot of pride in this school. 
People like to say, 'Oh, UCSD is 
boring,' but I really love it here, and 
I just want to show people that 
we're enjoying ourselves, and trying 
to make some people's days." 

Their latest video, based on 
Maroon S's "Sunday Morning," was 
made so fans could participate, and 
more than 30 students were includ-
ed in the video, which was finished 
in a month. 

"The hardest part is getting 
everyone together, because every-
one has their own schedules," 
Wang said. "Brainstorming is easy, 
editing is easy. The hard patt is 
actually getting out there to do the 
worlc." 

Due to the release of the new 
video on the site, Wong Fu 
Productions used up a month's 
allotted bandwidth in one night. 
They changed subscriptions to 
another Web server, but not before 
they were charged over $200 for 
the additional bandwidth. The site 
accepts donations, and the money 
goes toward maintaining site, not 
toward new equipment or to any 

membersofVVongFuProd~ons, 
according to members. 

Wong Fu Productions had 
planned to produce another video 
before the end of spring quatter, 
but busy schedules and workloads 
may prevent them from achieving 
their goal.

Lingel: A budding journalist 
with heart and dedication 
c:onrinIItd from fJO&r B 10 

Maybe that's too selfish or maybe 
it's too much to ask. So often, we at 
the GurdUm are working just to 
have people read the paper, and 
when they do, we wind up defend-
ing ourselves against criticism for 
one thing or another, some of 
which may have been deserved. 

But maybe that ideal critique 
isn't so impossible, because regard-
less of people who thought 1 was 
too liberal, too offensive or too 
defiant of set standards, I never felt 
that people were accusing me of 
not caring. 

"Don't be biner," my friend 
Vince said in regard to writing my 
senior sendoff. He should probably 
know, because in addition to being 
a great roommate and friend, Vince 
was a wonderful editor in chief and 
is a great journalist. 

I'm not bitter. In fact, I'm grate-
ful, because working at the 
G,...,.dill" reinforced all of the 
things I wanted to believe about 
working for a newspaper. 

The purpose of joumalism is not 
to persuade, but rather to infonn.lt's 
to learn as much as you can about the 
people and places and ideas around 
you, and to try to mold that into 
some presentable truth. 

I've loved learning about San 
Diego and UCSD while on cam-
pus. And I've loved learning about 
how to be a better writer, editor 
and friend. 

Thanks to Vince, Bill, Josh, 
Charlie and Lauren for the leader-
ship and friendship, and for allow-
ing me to bitch. To the Tuesday-
night Hiatus crew, I wouldn't have 
wanted to spend my late-night pro-

duction sessions with anyone else. 
Short kids really are cool. Cyn City, 
you're a dreamboat. Rachel, I can't 
thank you enough for every shred 
of sanity/ou enabled me to have. 
Milce an Michael - this paper 
could not run without you. 

It's easy to be bitter when you 
look back at something that took so 
much out of you. I can't deny the 
fact that there were a lot of nights 
at the production office where I just 
wanted to go home nor could 1 say 
that I never had problems with the 
way things were run or how people 
were treated. 

But for everything that newspa-
per took out of me,.1 gave a lot 
back. I worked really hard on every 
article I wrote, and I tried my best 
to be a responsible, discerning edi-
tor. 

It's all anyone can do to show up 
every day and work hard. The great 
thing about journalism is that in 
addition to showing up and work-
ing hard, the people who work on 
newspapers are really passionate 
about what they do. 

I've been very proud to spend 
my time at UCSD working at the 
GunJill1l because of all of the pas-
sionate people I have met and all of 
the time I have spent surrounded 
by people who really cared. 

If there's one thing that -I've 
taken away from working at the 
GlUlTdilln, it's the realization, 
"Wow, these lcids are working hard 
to put out the best paper they can 
for the students around them. And 
they are really passionate about 
journalism." It's been such a 
rewarding experience the whole 
way through.
