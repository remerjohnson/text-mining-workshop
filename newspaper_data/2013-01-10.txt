Two months after Proposition 30 
passed in the Nov. 6 election, the UC 
Board of Regents will hold a three-
day meeting at the UC San Francisco 
Mission Bay campus to discuss poten-
tial fee increases. The regents will also 
continue their November discussion 
about state funding and the UC bud-
get plan at the meeting.

As a result of Proposition 30’s 
passing, the UC Regents confirmed 
that there would be no systemwide 
tuition increase for students dur-
ing the 2012–2013 school year. In 
November, the regents discussed 
new ways to generate revenue, and 
confirmed their 2013–2014 academ-
ic year budget during a three-day 
meeting. Tuition and fee increases 
were recommended to aid the budget 
plan. The board requested a budget 
increase of $267 million from the 
state.

By increasing funding, the board 
hopes there will be higher enrollment 
and higher quality programs.

“Given the extraordinary decline 
in state funding, UC’s quality has not 
been prioritized as it should be,” the 
UC Budget for Current Operations 
for 2013–2014 states.

According to the UC 2013–2014 
budget plan, UC system administra-
tors plan to focus on increasing grad-
uate student support, reducing the 
student-faculty ratio, closing staff and 
faculty salary gaps, as well as libraries, 
building maintenance and instruc-
tional equipment and technology.

At the November meeting, the UC 
Regents discussed the possibility of a 
6 percent increase in tuition as a result 
of the regents’ budget strategy. The 
meeting focused on increasing state 
funding to avoid higher student fees.

The regents predict tuition will 
increase for the 2013–2014 school 
year if further state funding is not 
provided. At the Nov. 13 to 15 meet-
ing, Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov, 
Gavin Newsom claimed that addi-
tional state funding to the UC system 
is unlikely.

“The budget is unrealistic,” 
Newsom said at the meeting. “I’m 
concerned that the default to this plan 
is going to be to raise tuition to levels 
worse than what we were afraid of if 

Former Vice President Al Gore will 
visit the UCSD campus in February 
for a discussion and book signing. The 
Nobel Prize winner will speak at the 
event, which will take place Feb. 10 in 
the Mandeville Auditorium, and will 
be followed by a question and answer 
session.

Gore’s speech at UCSD is part of a 
national book tour for his newest work, 
“The Future: Six Drivers of Global 
Change.” The event will be hosted by 
La Jolla bookstore Warwick’s and is 
being co-promoted with the San Diego 
Law Library.

Warwick’s has hosted other speak-
ers on the UCSD campus in the past. 
In September, Warwick’s hosted author 
Salman Rushdie in conjunction with 
the Revelle Forum.

“Warwick’s has a history of host-
ing high profile speakers,” Warwick’s 
Director of Events Julie Slavinsky said. 
“It’s remarkable any time a university 
can host a speaker of this profile.”

Gore previously spoke at UCSD in 
2007 to present his Academy Award-
winning film “An Inconvenient Truth” 
in RIMAC Arena.

Tickets for the Gore speaking 
engagement are available to the public 
online through Warwick’s website and 
range in price from $35 to $50. The 
price of a ticket includes a copy of 
Gore’s book.

Students were spared 
fee hikes after Prop. 30’s 
passage but new increases 
may be on the table.

Several hundred UCSD students and faculty attended the first of several town hall forums 
this year on Tuesday, as part of the 
administration’s efforts to coordi-
nate a campuswide strategic plan-
ning process.

The meeting opened with 
Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla pre-
senting background on the strate-
gic planning process. Afterward 
the attendees were asked to par-
ticipate in a brainstorming session 
with Executive Vice Chancellor for 
Academic Affairs Suresh Subramani 
to address predicaments that the uni-

versity is facing, such as the high 
student to faculty ratio of 31-to-1 and 
its relatively low rate of alumni giving 
compared to peer universities.

“I am a strong believer in shared 
governancwe, and this strategic plan-
ning process is about working togeth-
er to develop shared goals and a uni-
fying vision for the future of UC San 
Diego,” Khosla said in a statement 
about the town hall meetings.

When asked about the strengths 
of UCSD during Tuesday’s brain-
storming session, students responded 
with the organization of the six-col-
lege system and a balanced com-

munity. The topic of how to improve 
the academic and social experience 
on campus resulted in various ideas, 
from creating bike paths to increasing 
transparency between administrators 
and students.

Raquel Morales, president of 
the University of California Student 
Association and UCSD undergradu-
ate, mentioned her concern about 
the growing use of online education 
throughout UC campuses.

“Online education may be good 
for the UC system, but it might not 
be the best for SD students,” Morales

The UCSD Microgravity Team 
has won the chance to take part in 
a NASA test flight in a recent con-
test. A team of 12 engineering stu-
dents won the proposal portion of 
the NASA Reduced Gravity Student 
Flight Opportunities Program 
and will send five members onto 
NASA’s Weightless Wonders aircraft 
in July to perform an experiment 
in a reduced-gravity environment 
to understand the droplet burn-
ing characteristics of bioethanol 
and biobutanol. The judges, a com-
mittee of NASA employees at the 
NASA headquarters in the Johnson 
Space Center in Houston, Texas, 
announced the winners on Dec. 5. 

The team’s proposal was an 
experiment to better understand 

biofuel combustion rates and com-
pare the results to previous experi-
ments that determined the combus-
tion rates of fossil fuels and non-
plant-based alcohols. 

“An improved understanding 
of the combustion of these bio-
fuels may lead to improvements 
in ground-based vehicle engines 
and fire safety aboard spacecrafts, 
among other possible innovations,” 
UCSD junior and flyer Sam Avery 
said.

The five members of the “fly 
team” are students Jack Goodwin, 
Victor Hong, Josh Sullivan, 
Daneesha Kenyon and project man-
ager Sam Avery. They will go on 
two flights, each with about 25 para-
bolic maneuvers that give the team 
a 20-second window of near-zero 
gravity to perform their experiment.

The experiment begins with a 
semi-automatic process that starts 
when the microprocessors sense the 
plane is entering microgravity. A 
syringe will release a droplet of the 

biofuels onto a wire held tightly 
across a box. The team will ignite the 
fuel and record the diameters of the 

droplets using special cameras. They 
expect to perform the experiment 
at least 30 times to ensure accuracy.

A reduced gravity environment 
is void of buoyancy — caused by 
gravity — that affects the shape of 
the droplets and could lead to inac-
curate data.

“It is very difficult to obtain accu-
rate burning rate data of spherically 
symmetric droplets under normal 
gravity conditions,” Avery said.

The plane creates the necessary 
reduced gravity conditions through 
continuous arched shaped flights. At 
the height of the parabola, weight-
lessness is felt, similar to the effect 
of a rollercoaster.

Part of the proposal also included 
an Outreach to Kids program. The

team members will visit underrepre-
sented schools in the San Diego area 
and carry out various demonstra-
tions, experiments and activities for 
students in grades K-12.

According to its website, the pur-
pose of the program is to “inspire 
young, underrepresented students 
to pursue an interest in STEM fields 
and show them that the possibility 
of doing so is achievable.”

Avery was inspired by the 
research of UCSD mechanical and 
aerospace engineering professor Dr. 
Forman A. Williams in the study of 
flames in microgravity, and wanted 
to conduct a combustion experi-
ment that hadn’t been done before, 
leading to the use of biofuels.

UCSD was chosen as one of the 
14 winners among the more than 50 
universities nationwide that entered 
the contest. NASA chose winners 
based on the quality of the research 
proposals and design of their exper-
iments.

“Although this is a great experi-
ence for us, I think it is even greater 

for UC San Diego, as we are get-
ting recognition on a national level,” 
ground crew member and aerospace 
engineering student Nico Montoya 

said. “We are helping to build a 
name for our school by accomplish-
ing something real and profession-
ally sponsored [by NASA], not just 

something done in the classroom.”

said. “The faculty needs to research 
before implementing these ideas.”

The administration is currently 
in the beginning phases of collecting 
information that began in November 
and will finish in February. All the 
information provided by faculty, 
staff, and students will be presented 
to the senior administration and the 
vice chancellor’s cabinet to be ana-
lyzed. Reappearing suggestions will 
be added as a part of a final vision 
statement that will be released in 
early April.

The first town hall meeting was 
open to all students and the next 
town hall meeting will focus specifi-
cally on graduate and professional 
students and will be held from 4:00 
p.m. to 5:30 p.m. tonight in the mul-
tipurpose room on the first floor of 
the Student Services Center.

Also in the meantime, the 
administration has created a variety 
of focus groups for specific topics. 
These focus groups will help address 
broader issues, such as diversity, 
student experience or research and 
educational experience. 

After solidifying five to 10 top-
ics, smaller groups of people, such 
as department chairs, faculty, and 
student organization leaders will be 
invited to represent broader com-
munities. 

Each unit will discuss with its 
respective vice chancellor its vision 
for a variety of criteria and what 

the measurable metrics are to deter-
mine whether the vision have or will 
achieve success.

Once the final vision statement 
is released, the administration will 
begin the final phase of implement-
ing the key aspects of each division.

“Ultimately, it’s about the alloca-
tion of resources,” Subramani said. 
“We need to take the highest priori-
ties and try to fund those first.”

Subramani thought that overall, 
the forum was successful in garner-
ing student input.

“The range of issues covered was 
huge,” Subramani said. “Many stu-
dents were not afraid to speak. There 
were students representing student 
leadership — president of this or 
that organization — so I feel like 
they’re speaking on behalf of the 
community at large, not only for 
themselves.”

Hundreds of faculty and staff 
joined the chancellor and other 
administrators during the first town 
hall meetings last quarter on Dec. 6 
and Dec. 10. University officials are 
seeking assistance from the campus 
community to tackle the challenge 
of increasing the quality of educa-
tion and the impact and influence of 
UCSD with decreasing funds.

“The planning process that we’ve 
initiated is bottom-up, inclusive and 
collaborative.  Everyone will have an 
opportunity to share ideas and give 
input,” Khosla said. “Whether you 
attend a town hall meeting or you 
submit a comment online, I encour-
age all students, faculty, staff and 
alumni to get involved.”

As my first coverage of A.S. 
Council, today’s meeting was certainly 
an eye-opener; I was not expecting it 
to be nearly as entertaining, but I am 
definitely not complaining.

After reports of members and 
public input were concluded, UCEN 
members, including chair Albert 
Trujillo, started off 
special presenta-
tions on a serious 
note, reviewing the 
University Centers 
Budget Overview 
and its current deficit. The deficit 
was said to have happened because 
of the 2008 fee increase, maintenance 
repairs, construction and staffing 
expenses, with expenses continuing 
to increase because of work including 
maintenance issues, computing servic-
es and the programming of The Loft. 
UCEN has already reduced expendi-
tures in various aspects, and UCAB 
will be stepping in to help, presenting 
a UCEN fee increase referendum in 
the near future.

“I appreciate you coming here 
to explain the UCEN budget, and I 
would like to extend my office’s ser-
vices for any of UCEN’s needs”, AVP 
Environmental and Social Justice 
Vanessa Garcia said.

AVP Student Services John Weng 
concluded special presentations with 
an extensive presentation on Triton 
Activities Planner, highlighting its 
importance and saying it is required 
by organizations when preparing for 
events, and must be completed accord-
ing to TAP rules and regulations.

During reports of members, AVP 
Concerts and Events Eric Babajanian 
released the results of the Sun God 
survey, announcing that hip-hop and 
Top-40 are tied in the top music genres 
for this year’s Sun God performances. 
He also announced his Sun God 

Festival Open Forum scheduled for 
Jan. 11, as well as a new event series at 
Home Plate. Kicking off the series will 
be Level 2, a nightclub-themed event 
that is free for all UCSD students.

Question time was the big winner 
of the night, with council announcing 
Biological Sciences Senator Jonathan 

Cheung as “fac-
tor of the week,” 
and then breaking 
out in a catwalk 
competition after 
Revelle Chair 

Meena Kaushik announced the 
upcoming Catwalk Fashion Show. Six 
council members were nominated on 
the spot, and participated in a sponta-
neous showdown, with AVP Concerts 
and Events Eric Babajanian and VP 
Student Life Cody Marshall winning 
the most votes.

Council moved to new busi-
ness, revisiting the ongoing co-op 
discussion. A.S. President Meggie Le 
moved to enter a new council resolu-
tion for the General Store Co-op, 
after a previous resolution from fall 
quarter’s Week 8 council meeting 
was withdrawn after the Graduate 
Student Association concluded that 
the resolution included Master Space 
Agreement regulation violations. Le 
and A.S. Director Heather Belk will 
meet with the heads of MSA and GSA 
to amend or draft a new MSA to keep 
the co-ops afloat.

“Even though we are taking back 
the previous resolution, we are still on 
the side of the co-ops,” Le said.

Council ended quite early today, 
after a short open forum announc-
ing Muir Senator Hope Czbas’s BSU 
Culture Show planning and a round 
of applause for the Fashion Show 
models. At least now they’ll have 
some extra time to work on their run-
way walks.

Time to 
Change 
Up Greek 
Charities
brad  segal jsegal@ucsd.eduBro's  eye  view

Real talk — most sororities throw some variant of the same philanthropic event 
every year. Don’t get me wrong: 
I think annual charities are a 
necessary cornerstone for every 
Greek chapter. Yet you probably feel 
that buying a ticket to some buzzkill 
performance in the Price Center 
ballrooms a dozen times a year gets 
old fast. But more consequentially, 
due to the administration’s funding 
rules, A.S. Council can no longer 
provide necessary funding for 
charitable events that charge 
admission. Think about that. 

Ticketed PC ballroom 
philanthropies have definitely 
served their purpose. But instead 
of doubling down on donations 
and raffle tickets to raise money 
at the same kind of events, the 
new funding changes mean that 
we should finally shift away from 
hosting philanthropies that only 
engage Greeks. The ability to host an 
event that can pack a PC ballroom 
with wildly cheering students, 
including otherwise checked-out 
upperclassman, is something that 
Greeks should be proud of. This is 
especially true given that it’s Greeks 
who are out showing a commitment 
to charity — not to mention how few 
other campus communities can rally 
this kind of attendance without the 
use of copious student-fee-funded 
swag. But many students outside 
the Greek system don’t know how 
big of a deal Greek philanthropies 
really are. Greeks should use the 
momentum they can build up 
around charitable causes to start new 
annual philanthropies that engage 
students who otherwise wouldn’t 
interact with this side of Greek life. 

Staying real here, there are a lot 
of bro-haters on campus who just 
straight-up don’t like the idea of 
Greek life. Just look at the incisive 
comments on Confession #794, 
which is a complaint from a frat 
bro that he’s tired of partying with 
the same sororities. I’ve found that, 
generally speaking, people who are 
against Greek life are people who 
don’t get it. Interacting with Greeks 
in a philanthropic context will 
combat stigmatization far better than 
flame wars on Facebook. 

You’d be surprised, but 
philanthropies are actually more 
than a competition to see how many 
pitchers the judges can crush before 
the event. UCSD Greeks raise tens 
of thousands of dollars a year for 
charity. Though given that there 
will no longer be A.S. funding for 
ticketed charities, if UCSD Greeks 
want to keep raising the same 
amounts of money for charity, 
there’ve gotta be changes. 

New annual philanthropies can 
still be see-and-be-seen events for 
Greeks. Like at Bear Garden, there 
are ways to do that without leaving 
out a big chunk of the campus. True, 
each chapter will need to get creative 
to come up with its own engaging 
and high-publicity charity. It’ll also 
take a lot of impetus and guts to 
convince an entire sorority to move 
away from an event it’s been putting 
on annually for years. But for better 
or for worse, revenue from ticket 
sales is no longer available. We might 
as well use this change to add a little 
more oomph to student life at UCSD 
while helping the student body see 
what our Greek life is all about.

A Sun God lineup that includes 
names that we actually recognize.

A.S. funding has understandably taken 
a blow over the last few years, but not 
all good musical acts are too expen-
sive to book. We’d like this year’s Sun 
God Festival to exhibit a range of 
more interesting new artists in favor of 
mid-level starpower (less weak one-hit 
rappers and inexplicable early-2000s 
emo bands). 

Modest tuition hikes.

UC students scored a big victory 
when Prop. 30 passed in November, 
effectively blocking a $2400 spike in 
tuition costs this year. However, with 
the state budget forecasting more 
cuts to education, future hikes are 
inevitable. We hate to see any sort 
of fee increases in 2013, but if costs 
do go up, we hope the increases are 
minimal and do not affect the abil-
ity of many students to afford a UC 
education.

Better dining hall food.

Every UCSD student looks for-
ward to Triton Day — and not just 
because they get to adopt worthier-
than-thou attitudes toward the new-
bies. Once parents and prospective 
students enter a five-mile radius 
of campus, all dining halls scurry 
to hide the questionable “pho” and 
bring out the gourmet New York 
steaks. If only every day was like 
Triton Day.

Jobs for us when we graduate. 

Many of us will be graduating in 
2013, and with youth unemployment 
rates at a dire 11.5%, it’s a shaky time 
to be entering the job market. While 
it might be nice to chill at mom and 
dad’s house for six months after 
graduation, losing opportunities to 
hone skills needed for future jobs 
could cost graduates a great future 
entirely. We’d like to see Washington 
focus more on creating jobs, and less 
on the national debt in 2013. 

Improved logo or better yet, we 
wish we didn’t have to be wishing 
about a logo. 

The new UC logo spawned a student 
backlash unseen since…never. Tears 
were shed. Feelings were hurt. Either 
the UC needs to stop trying so hard 
to be “hip” in designing its next logo, 
or people just need to stop throw-
ing hissy fits about things that don’t 
really matter.

No more Lip Dub.

Dozens of student organizations 
(including The Guardian) were humil-
iated for several hours last Spring 
when they were asked to participate 
in A.S. Council’s promotional “Lip 
Dub” event. Not only was the finished 
product embarrassing (to say the 
least), but a parody version of Katy 
Perry’s “TGIF” rhymed “Planning for 
Hullaballoo” with “Shooting hoops 
with Penny Rue.” We hope 2013 is as 
Lip Dub-free as possible.

No more jizzing in food and soap 
dispensers. 

Far too many UCSD Confessions 
revealed strategic and frankly appalling 
hiding spots for human semen (includ-
ing guacamole at Goody’s and soap 
dispensers in Price Center). Regardless 
of the factuality of these confessions, 
we think it’s a reasonable request to ask 
that we never have to worry about our 
food or sanitation tools containing any 
bodily fluids. Seriously.

To not have to pay for unpaid 
internships.

With fewer jobs comes more com-
petition, making internships com-
pleted during college increasingly 
important. The problem is that many 
students cannot afford to pay for 
expensive summer units in order to 
work for credit. Getting school credit 
during the school year is admittedly 
more feasible, but not everyone 
has the privilege of spending 10-20 
hours a week working for free. 

More 24-hour places on campus.

The inconvenient thing about pulling 
all-nighters is the glaring fact that you 
still need to eat. We’ve gained serious, 
albeit small, headway last year with 
Geisel finally opening a 24-hour study 
space. Now all we’re missing is a con-
venient spot to grab coffee and a sand-
wich at any hour of the night. We wish 
UCSD had a Denny’s Free Express like 
CSU San Bernardino. 

Higher turnouts at athletic 
events. And more free giveaways. 

Regardless of what side you took in 
the Division I debate last year, it’s 
undeniable that the athletes on our 
campus put in hours upon hours 
of hard work to compete for our 
school. We should reward them by 
filling out the stands during games. 
The Athletic Department should 
host more Spirit Night-type events 
and have more UCSD “swag” give-
aways to foster larger crowds at
athletic games.

People to be informed while 
following social movements.

Between the short-lived KONY 2012 
fiasco and the UC logo uproar, 2012 
somehow became the year of the 
misguided hacktivist. The internet 
offers a rare opportunity for world-
wide dialogue and mobilization, 
so this year let’s not squander that 
resource on half-baked bandwagon-
ing and trendy propaganda.

No more “mullet clothing.”

The mullet clothing trend started in 
festivals and somehow spread to infect 
women’s everyday wardrobes. You 
know what it is: those skirts and dresses 
that look like an elegant floor-length, 
until you realize that the entire front of 
the skirt is missing. You think, maybe 
it got caught in a door, or maybe that 
girl can’t afford a complete skirt — but 
really it is just a dumb trend that we 
hope will die in the same manner that 
Crocs were ostracized.

A catchy song that’s not “Call 
Me Maybe.” 

Yes, “Call Me Maybe” (one of our songs 
of the year — pg. 7)brought a slew of 
delightful YouTube videos, memes and 
group-singing at parties, but it is time 
to move on. “Gangnam Style” would 
have been a good substitute except that 
most people can’t pronounce the lyrics.

What We’re Wishing For in 2013  
Chancellor Pradeep Khosla created town hall forms to ask what students would like to see change at UCSD.  This 

inspired the Guardian’s Editorial Board to compile a list of things that we want this year.

THE

BEST
OF

2012

Movies
1. Holy  Motors    By Ren Ebel                            Leos Carax’ “Holy Motors” is a film about the death 

of film. But, ironically (and to Carax’ credit), no other recent film has more fully embraced the 
philosophy and potential of digital cinema to such a shocking and spectacular degree. The film 
takes place in some loosely-defined alternate reality — the near future, perhaps — where actors 
act out their “scenes” in public spaces, without cameras. But “Holy Motors” can hardly be confined 
to any sci-fi subgenre, as it functions more as a collection of beautiful and loosely-connected film 
scenes, each acted out by the film’s single protagonist (a chameleon method actor in this camera-
less universe who is carted from assignment to mysterious assignment in a white limo). One scene 
follows a hitman who murders his doppelganger, while another recounts a bizzare fantasy about a 
flower-eating, sewer-dwelling troll. And these are simply two pitstops in a seemingly endless string 
of scenes — each of which play with film conventions and the possibilities of digital intervention 
by way of green screen and motion capture effects. Carax has created a timeless classic, as well as 
our generation’s answer to “Singin’ In The Rain.” “Holy Motors” even has enough sheer ambition, 
humor and transgressive cynicism to match (musical show-stoppers included). 

2. The   Master      By Sebastian Brady                             The main character of “The Master,” 
Freddie Quell — brilliantly played by a haggard, sickly Joaquin Phoenix — introduces himself 
by way of frantically dry-humping a sand model of a woman. When we meet Lancaster Dodd, 
Phoenix’s co-star Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he describes himself as “above all a man” and not, as 
he later explains, part of the animal kingdom. For the rest of “The Master,” director Paul Thomas 
Anderson (“There Will Be Blood”) explores the interaction between Quell’s carnal animalism and 
Dodd’s humanistic refinement.

This exploration takes place in the frame of a thinly veiled rehash of Scientology’s history, set in 
1950s America. We see Quell chafe under any authority or attempt to bind his animalistic nature, 
while Dodd needs Quell’s devotion, if not his complete conversion, to continue his cause. Shot in 
visually astounding 65mm, “The Master” again proves Anderson is capable of getting amazing per-
formances from his actors and crafting them into a complete masterpiece.

3. Django  Unchained      By Jacey Aldredge                          When the title character has his 
own original theme song, either you’re watching Nickelodeon reruns or something is seriously 
about to blow your mind. Quentin Tarantino likes his films the slow-burning, meticulous way, 
but when he finally does knock out one of his long-awaited works, it throws a helluva punch. 
“Django Unchained” in no way escaped this habit, utilizing every necessary element — lush 
dust-blown sceneries, rich dialogue, enduring characters — for a shoot-‘em-up classic in the 
making. The film tackles America’s touchiest subject with anything but grace and sophistication; 
violence, vulgarity, and vengeance drive home this cowboy blood battle in traditional Tarantino 
manner, armed and ready with his swashbuckling, outlawed heroes and villainous southern 
gents of a cast. Quentin Tarantino brought the fire; Christoph Waltz, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo 
DiCaprio and Kerry Washington fuel it with fury. 

4. Beasts of the Southern  Wild      By Jacey Aldredge                      Not since “Pan’s 
Labyrinth” has a movie exploded with such cosmic strength and clarity so sharp it cuts right into 
your heart. The little engine that could, “Beasts” tore through film festivals all year (winning at 
Cannes, Sundance and NYIF, to name a few), a bitingly original fable of post-Katrina Louisiana 
and the small-but-mighty Quvenzhane Wallis who carries this robust, idiosyncratic film with 
a poise and electricity unheard of in girls of only six years old. Her relationship with Dwight 
Henry, the erratic and drunken father who just wants his girl to survive, is so heartfelt it’s hard to 
believe they were acting at all. Ah, and that is the rub.  

5. Moonrise  Kingdom      By Arielle Sallai        You gotta hand it to the haters: Wes 
Anderson makes relentlessly quirky comedies. Stylized to a T, Anderson’s body of work is instantly 
recognizable — and divisive. Yet when his films are as outstanding as “Moonrise Kingdom,” the hat-
ers don’t stand a chance. 

The film’s dreamy setting of 1965 New England served the director’s quirky style well, making 
the over-stylization appear era-appropriate and not like style for style’s sake. A wistful look at a pair 
of 12-year-old runaways — an orphaned “Khaki Scout” (Jared Gilman) and an eccentric bookworm 
(Kara Hayward) — and the ragtag group of adults who set out to find them (including Bruce Willis, 
Edward Norton, and Bill Murray), “Moonrise Kingdom” packs a ton of heart and a ton of humor. 
The portrayal of the kids’ blossoming, first-time love is tender without being creepy, while the 
unpredictable shenanigans that ensue keep the laughs coming.

6. The  Comedy      By Ren Ebel           Of all the films to come out this year, none felt as 
urgently relevant as Rick Alverson’s poignant hipster deconstruction “The Comedy.” The scowling, 
apathetic slackers at the center of the film are as completely unlikable as they are familiar. As we 
follow the dull group from one numbingly sarcastic conversation to the next, the inherent sadness 
beneath the facade becomes frighteningly transparent. Just as admirable, is Tim Heidecker’s (“Tim 
and Eric’s Awesome Show, Great Job”) turn as the never-serious, yet clearly depressed Swanson. 

7. Lincoln      By Jacey Aldredge                  In a year full of films portraying life as it could 
be, or life as it is, “Lincoln” split the Red Sea with a life as it was, catapulting to fruition the con-
struction of a country trying to build itself from the ground up, and the man who championed 
a battle-born American dream. It’s an origin story everyone should take the time to experience, 
if not for Tony Kushner’s rich storytelling (he forged a script so natural you’d think he brought 
it back from 1865 himself), then for Daniel-Day Lewis’s resonating, under-the-skin transforma-
tion into a man we never thought would walk the earth again. 

8. Silver  Linings  Playbook      By Jacey Aldredge                                           It’s always the quiet ones 
that have the most to say. “Silver Linings” didn’t garner much talk prior to its release, but once it hit 
theaters, the story of the batshit-crazy couple and the town around them couldn’t get out of anyone’s 
head. And why should it have to? Writer-director David O. Russell transformed an already-riveting 
novel into a concoction of smart dialogue and unsettlingly honest situations. He provided a refresh-
ing spin on the overused themes found in recent romantic comedies, replacing cliche kisses in the 
rain with unfiltered, late-night runs down the streets of Philly. “Dinner and a movie” made way 
for “dinner and broken dishes.” Though Russell’s script was brilliant on its own, the playbook that 
brought it all home were the actors who brought life to the insanity. It’s a hard task to evoke both 
empathy and laughter out of an audience for the same moment, but this cast, from Bradley Cooper 
to Robert DeNiro to Jennifer Lawrence, achieved just that. 

9. Skyfall      By Jacey Aldredge                    Up until this most recent 007 adventure, Ian 
Fleming’s original superspy (and his Aston Martin) and the grounded depths of character held 
within him went mostly avoided, if not forgotten. Sam Mendes’ broke this convention with 
“Skyfall”, a crisply designed homage to smart thrillers and the always-classic car chase. “Don’t 
cock it up,” trilled Judi Dench’s M, and they certainly do not. Though Mendes and his writing 
cohorts traveled back to Bond’s roots, they weren’t afraid of teaching the old dog new tricks, 
bringing originality and spunk to their villain (a delightfully treacherous Javier Bardem) and 
paving the way for an alluring new road of Bond with the introduction of Ralph Fiennes, the 
new face of M16. Amid all of these adjustments, Daniel Craig continues to impress as the steely 
faced, smirk mouthed Bond; if the 24th installment is anything like its predecessor, the future is 
looking quite bright indeed.

10. This is 40      By Jacey Aldredge                        What was supposed to be a “kind-of sequel” 
to Judd Apatow’s “Knocked-Up” has turned into a testament to the middle class, middle-aged peo-
ple of America — cupcakes, creepy body trainers, sneaking cigarettes and all. “This is 40” throws 
out brash, slapstick humor in favor of the much more realistic qualms that life throws our way, full 
of more “that totally happens” moments than reality television could ever spit out. Floppy-haired 
Paul Rudd and quick-witted Leslie Mann are a pleasure to watch on screen as they maneuver their 
way around children, financial distress and surfacing daddy issues, only to find their way back into 
the chaotic normality known as getting old. Apatow has a knack for stringing together reflections 
of the blemished and battered trials of life in a way that makes hard-knock humanity all the more 
appealing, but not since “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” has he gotten relationships more right.

ALBUMS songs
1.  "Channel Orange" -  Frank  Ocean     by Sebastian Brady                                                                              

 Frank Ocean is patient. He spent years in record label purgatory before releasing his debut 
album “Channel Orange” last summer. Given the album’s universal acclaim, it seems Ocean’s 
turn as an R&B superstar has finally come.

Judging by the album, his wait wasn’t easy. The emotions that Ocean tackles make “Channel 
Orange” feel like a 17-track private therapy session set to music. He is disillusioned and sui-
cidal on “Super Rich Kids”. He plays a shamed, destitute crack addict on “Crack Rock.” In “Bad 
Religion,” the album’s emotional center, Ocean laments unrequited love, choking out “I could 
never make him love me” in a plaintive falsetto. All of this is described in lyrics that are mini-
mal yet evocative and powerful.

2. "The  Idler  Wheel" - Fiona  Apple     By Ren Ebel                                           With her hoards of 
quirky, bespectacled followers, Fiona Apple has been responsible for some pretty obnoxious music. 
But there is a striking quality that separates Apple from the Michaelsons and Spektors whose 
tooth-rotting sweetness has soundtracked every Mac commercial of the last decade. She’s god-
damned ferocious. And her latest and greatest achievement, “The Idler Wheel” strikes with devas-
tating force. It is an album about sex and self-loathing. It’s a fantastic breakup album for the ages, 
but it’s also one of the most uplifting of the year. While much modern pop is dependent on ultra-
sleek production, an album like “The Idler Wheel” can get lost in the shuffle. But if you’re looking 
for transcendence, you can find it in the simple playfulness of “Hot Knife” or the goose bump-
inducing one-line timewarp that occurs on “Anything We Want,” as childhood friends go from 
playing hooky in middle school to facing the awkward and messy realities of a first sexual encoun-
ter. If anyone has a chance of rekindling the importance of raw songwriting, it’s Fiona Apple.

3. "Good  Kid M.a.a.d. city" - Kendrick  lamar      By sebastian brady
The subtitle of Kendrick Lamar’s massively successful “good kid, m.A.A.d city” is “A Short 

Film By Kendrick Lamar.” It makes sense. Lamar does not rap so much as he tells stories. And 
“good kid, m.A.A.d city” is his story. Lamar turns Rosecrans Avenue, Compton’s main thor-
oughfare, into Memory Lane, driving us through how and where he grew up. We see him pur-
suing women, committing robberies, getting jumped and mourning his friend’s murder. At the 
same time, we see an innocent child falling victim to peer pressure and violent circumstances. 
The album is so personal it’s uncomfortable.

But none of this would work if Lamar weren’t a gifted rapper. He switches tempos, rhyme 
schemes and subjects seamlessly, and he has a keen ear for beats. While the term “instant clas-
sic” was thrown around as soon as “good kid, m.A.A.d city” dropped, it’s too early for that. All 
we can say for now is that it’s a brave, vulnerable, shameless, poignant offering from one of the 
best young rappers of his generation.

4. "Swing  lo  magellan" - dirty projectors     By andrew whitworth
After mastering complex, Talking Heads-style funk pop on 2009’s classic “Bitte Orca,” 

Brooklyn’s Dirty Projectors found themselves facing monumental expectations on their follow-
up, this year’s “Swing Lo Magellan.” Somehow, the Projectors, under the command of eccentric 
songwriter David Longstreth, managed to more than meet these expectations, crafting what 
might be the year’s most thoughtful, forward-thinking rock album. Spanning everything from 
Os Mutantes-baiting psychedelic guitar dirges (“Maybe That Was It”) to off-kilter R&B (“See 
What She Seeing”) and heartfelt folk-pop (the restrained, hummable title track), “Swing Lo 
Magellan” proved to be one of the year’s most endlessly replay-able albums.

5. "Mature  Themes" - Ariel Pink's haunted graffitti     By ren ebel
Ever since Ariel Pink brought his home-recorded pop-rock masterpieces to the studio, his wild-

ly experimental approach to traversing AM radio, ’60s pop, ’80s pop and psych rock has reached a 
wider audience. But where Pink’s classic “Before Today” tamed some of the songwriter’s more self-
indulgent explorations, the epic, concept-driven “Mature Things” does not hold back. The album 
loosely follows the exploits of an L.A. rock star (Pink), and the album’s fantastic songs seem divided 
between those that Pink’s character is performing on stage, and those that reflect his inner rocker-
on-the-edge turmoil. But “Mature Themes” is never anchored by the concept. Like “Before Today,” 
“Mature Themes” is, above all, a collection of tremendous and wholly original songs. From the 
jubilant golden-era homage of “Only In My Dreams” and the title track, to the unmistakably Pink 
originals like “Schnitzel Boogie” and “Symphony of the Nymph,” “Mature Themes” has confirmed 
Pink’s place as one of our most inventive and talented modern songwriters.

6. "Total  loss" - how  to  dress  well     By andrew whitworth                                                                                                                                          
Of the legions of young musicians trying to escape the chillwave-witch house-PBR&B axis of 

genre limitations, none have done so as effectively as Tom Krell, the Chicago songwriter behind 
How to Dress Well. Drawing in equal part upon R&B, late-’90s neo-soul and elegiac hip-hop 
in the vein of Clams Casino, Krell uses “Total Loss” to document the process of grieving he 
experienced when several people close to him died last year. Across beautiful, aching tracks like 
the Steve Reich-indebted “Say My Name Or Say Whatever” or the cuddly neo-soul of “Running 
Back,” Krell examines themes of isolation, hope and, of course, loss with brutal efficacy. 

7. "evans  the  death" - evans  the  death     By arielle sallai                                                                                                                                             
Rarely does a band’s debut come out as fully formed as Evans the Death’s. The self-titled 

album sounds like the new project of a late- ’‘80s indie-pop great, not like the work of a troupe of 
fresh-faced Londoners. Comprised of short, sweet, melody-driven songs lush with whirling guitar 
jangle, “Evans the Death” is the perfect pop album. What’s more, lead singer Katherine Whitaker’s 
Chrissie Hynde-esque belt steals the show, making droll lyrics about hating children and watching 
a TV docudrama reach Morrissey-esque levels of melodrama.

8. "oshin" - diiv      By arielle sallai                                                                                     A lot of great indie-rock records came out 
this year, but none were quite as dazzling as DIIV’s “Oshin.” It’s a slow burner — not as imme-
diately loveable as, say, the retro grooves of Tame Impala’s “Lonerism” or the Husker Du-esque 
throwback of The Men’s “Open Your Heart.” Instead, “Oshin” succeeds in a different way: It was’s 
2012’s most atmospheric album. 

These are songs composed entirely around ambling guitar lines, much like those of Real 
Estate’s or Beach Fossils’, the band DIIV’s Z. Cole Smith sometimes plays guitar for. Coupled with 
moments of shoegaze-esque walls of sound and sparse, frequently unintelligible lyrics, the loose 
guitars immediately recall the rise and fall of — what else — the ocean (or should we say “oshin”?). 
Take this one to a cold beach.

9." fin" - john  talabot      By andrew whitworth                                                                                                                      With artists like Grimes 
and The xx occupying the cultural ground formerly held by acts like Feist or The Shins, the last 
year provided an opportunity for forward-thinking electronic producers to exhibit their work in 
pop-dominated spheres. At the head of this movement is Barcelonan house magician John Talabot, 
who began 2012 with only a couple of relatively unknown 12-inch records under his belt and ended 
it opening massive venues for The xx on their recent international tour. This rapid ascension is easy 
to understand when listening to “Fin”: tracks like “Destiny” combine melodically forward indie pop 
with more floor-friendly structures while songs like the devastating “So Will Be Now...” infuse cere-
bral house with a romantic attitude.

10. "bish  bosch" - scott  walker      By ren ebel                                                                                                                    Scott Walker has had no 
difficulty defying the expectations of his fans and horrified onlookers over the course of his totally 
bizarre career. Once a suave — if occasionally eccentric — pop crooner in the 1960s, Walker more 
recently came out of hiding to completely reinvent his music with a string of three devastating and 
darkly sparse avant-garde works. But nowhere other than “Bish Bosch” has this master of unrelent-
ing darkness been so much fun. There are horn sections, dog barks and towering string crescendos. 
There’s a nearly 20-minute song whose lyrics disintegrate into bad stand-up comedy jokes. And 
quite possibly for the first time in music history, there are musical farts that can only be appropri-
ately described as haunting. But always, Walker’s dark Poe-toned stories blister beneath his restlessly 
inventive scores. 

"backstreet  freestyle" - Kendrick  lamar     by Sebastian Brady
Kendrick Lamar usually eschews traditional brag-rap for more serious storytelling, so when 

he gets playful (over a Hit-Boy-produced beat, no less), it’s worth listening to. Whether spitting 
lines like, “I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower/ So I can fuck the world for 72 hours,” or 
implicitly comparing himself to Martin Luther King, Lamar shows that even when he’s joking, 
he isn’t afraid to think a little bigger.

"Call  me  maybe"- carly  rae  jepsen     By andrew whitworth
2012 was a good year for pop radio. With Hit-Boy continuing to produce sonically ambi-

tious rap anthems and artists like Miguel and Kendrick Lamar slowly infiltrating Top-40 
airwaves, the radio continued to seem like a more and more inviting place. One factor in this 
transition was Carly Rae Jepsen’s genius pop anthem “Call Me Maybe.” At times coming across 
more like a lost late-’90s French house track than the work of an aging Canadian pop singer, 
“Call Me Maybe” is full of subtle disco shimmer, lending a subtle forward momentum to that 
epic chorus. Just listen to that chorus.

"cheap  beer - ridlar      By taylor hogshead                                                                                                    Los Angeles punk-rock 
quartet FIDLAR, also known as Fuck-It-Dude-Life’s-A-Risk, has braved the grimy abyss 
of the underground scene to release its anticipated self-titled LP in 2013. Their last year’s 
single “Cheap Beer” positioned the group as the current forerunners in the craft of anthemic 
slackerdom. The tune’s mantra is as simple as it is unbearably catchy. “I drink cheap beer/ 
So what?/ Fuck you!” can come off as an unwarranted stance of aggression, yet in the ear of 
the right beholder, it stands as cry for solidarity. If you’re particularly interested in joining 
FIDLAR’s eternal struggle for good times, check them out at the Che Cafe on Jan. 25. 

"everything  is  embarrassing" - sky  ferreira     By sebastian brady
“Everything Is Embarrassing” starts off sounding downright peppy, opening with an upbeat 

drum kit that would fit perfectly on a Wham! track from the ’80s. From there, though, every-
thing darkens. A somber piano joins in the otherwise pop-heavy track. Once arriving to the 
chorus, a synth wails as Sky Ferreira groans “Maybe if you tried/ then I would not bother.” Even 
though we end up in a dark, self-conscious place, the descent is gorgeous.

"mercy" - Kanye  West    sebastian brady                                                                                                 For the first four minutes, 
“Mercy” is a good rap song, with impressive verses from Big Sean, Pusha T and Kanye West 
over a great beat. However, when you hear someone bellowing “TWO CHAAAAYYYNZ,” 
you realize something bigger is happening. Ninety seconds later, with lines like “I’m drunk 
and high at the same time/ drinking champagne on an airplane” ringing through your head, 
you grasp that you’ve just been introduced to 2 Chainz, and that things will never be the 
same.

"oblivion" - grimes     By arielle sallai                                                                                      Claire Boucher’s breakthrough sin-
gle, “Oblivion,” paints a fairly incongruous image. On the one hand, the artist (better known 
as Grimes) sounds like a 15-year-old girl doing a Mariah Carey high-note impression. On 
the other hand, lumbering, one-note synth and lyrics tinged with violence give the track a 
much deeper impact. 

It’s virtually every woman’s story, as Boucher demonstrates by explaining why she can’t 
walk alone after dark (“Someone could break your neck/ Coming up behind you and you’d 
never have a clue”). This reference to sexual abuse is made even clearer in the music video  
— a montage of the artist surrounded by displays of overt masculinity (a crowd at a football 
game, a locker room, a mosh pit of shirtless bros, et cetera). 

Still, with good-natured melodies that aren’t ashamed of their bubblegum influence, 
“Oblivion” is more catharsis than doom and gloom. Watch Boucher bop around gleefully in 
the video and you’ll see — it’s the obvious girl-power anthem of the year.

"only  in  my  dreams" - ariel  pink's  haunted  graffitti     By ren ebel                                                                                                                                    
 Rarely does a band’s debut come out as fully formed as Evans the Death’s. The self-titled album 

sounds like the new project of a late- ’‘80s indie-pop great, not like the work of a troupe of fresh-
faced Londoners. 

 Comprised of short, sweet, melody-driven songs lush with whirling guitar jangle, “Evans 
the Death” is the perfect pop album. What’s more, lead singer Katherine Whitaker’s Chrissie Hynde-
esque belt steals the show, making droll lyrics about hating children and watching a TV docudrama 
reach Morrissey-esque levels of melodrama.

 "super  rich  kids" - Frank  ocean      By andrew whitworth
Perfectly representing the Southern California social commentary angle of Frank Ocean’s 

outstanding “Channel Orange” (see also: “Sweet Life,” “Pilot Jones”), “Super Rich Kids” accom-
plishes with a speak-sing chorus and loping beat what Randy Newman spent most of the 1970s 
trying to achieve. Add Earl Sweatshirt’s genius verse (where else would you find a line like 
“brash as fuck/ breaching all these aqueducts”) and you have one of the year’s most exuberantly 
critical hip-hop tracks.

"werewolf" - Fiona  apple      By arielle sallai                                                                                                      On the surface, it might 
not seem like Fiona Apple has changed much since she debuted as a teenager back in 1996. 
Now 34, she’s as emotionally volatile as ever, spending most of “The Idler Wheel…” switch-
ing unpredictably between minor-key piano flushes and more aggressive pounding. On 
album highlight “Werewolf,” however, Apple laments the former, providing a level of self-
awareness she once seemed too earnest to embrace. 

The usually scathing Apple saves the harshest criticisms for herself, comparing an ex-
lover to a werewolf while admitting she “provided the full moon.” Comprised of mostly just 
piano, with the unusual addition of a recording of children screaming near the end, the 
track conveys a feeling of acceptance rarely seen from someone so proudly temperamental. 
“Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key,” she sings in the somber closing refrain, 
finally realizing that sometimes a sad ending is better than none at all. 

"&  it  was  you" - How  to  dress  well      By andrew whitworth
Though How to Dress Well’s 2012 release “Total Loss” was packed with highlights, none 

managed to stick with the listener like the sprightly “& It Was U,” likely the album’s most pop-
friendly track. The most immediately noticeable part of “& It Was U” is that, yes, it literally 
contains no instruments other than drum machine. Rather than being alienating, as one might 
imagine, this decision allows Krell’s vocals to achieve a kind of rhythmic agility that a more clut-
tered instrumental wouldn’t allow. Coupled with the song’s impeccable melody, this willingness 
to be bold in both structure and presentation made “& It Was U” one of the year’s most satisfy-
ing pop moments.

THE UCSD GUARDIAN |  THURSDAY, JANUARY 10,  2013 |  www.UCSDGUARDIAN.oRG     W5LIFESTYLE
Bars and 
Boys: Is 21 
Really That 
Different?
laira  martin lmm002@ucsd.eduThis  modern  love

After a long overdue winter break in my hometown of Hollywood, I returned to San 
Diego with a few thoughts on dat-
ing as an undergrad. In my first two 
years as a student everything was still 
sort of confusing and now that I’m a 
junior, it seems as if everything has 
fallen into place — except dating. I’ve 
gotten my own apartment, a job, semi 
long-term life plans etc. but if there’s 
anything my Jewish mother reminded 
me of over break, it was that I have 
no boyfriend. Don’t get me wrong, it 
would be nice, but it’s not something 
I’m actively seeking at the moment. 
But as all my friends and I approach 
our infamous 21st birthdays, our dat-
ing lives are going to surround bars 
rather than frat parties (fine by me) 
but it will undeniably be different. 

I’ve only spent a brief amount of 
time at La Jolla dive bars. There’s real-
ly only one (London’s West End), and 
the crowd there is questionable to say 
the least. I have spent my fair share of 
time at LA bars, which is pretty much 
a straightforward douchefest, but I 
can’t help but keep going back. 

The thing I like most about San 
Diego is its straightforwardness. For 
some reason, I’ve gotten a sense that 
beach people are more honest than 
city people (or at least LA city people), 
There are a few types of people you 
will meet at a hip Los Angeles bar (i.e. 
Harvard & Stone in East Hollywood), 
none of which you’d want to bring 
home to Mom. There’s the aspiring 
actor/musician/yogi. There’s the guy 
who looks constantly bitter because 
he thinks he’s above the bar scene 
yet he seems to be there every night. 
There’s a plethora of guys that want 
to hit it and quit it. There’s the guy 
you gave your number to last time 
and end up avoiding the whole night. 
And once in awhile there’s a guy that 
you have good conversation with 
that seems legitimately interesting 
until you drop the bomb that you’re 
on winter break and have to return 
to college in just a few short weeks. 
All of the above should be pictured 
with facial hair and/or a douchey hat. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to 
hipster shame (there are few things I 
appreciate more than a good looking 
hipster guy), but just going out to bars 
on a Saturday night sets a tone for 
one’s experience in itself. 

But now that I’m back in San 
Diego and I’ve put my bi-city lifestyle 
to rest for awhile I’m curious what’s in 
store for the next quarter. Will I even-
tually find a fun bar in San Diego? 
I’ve been meaning to check out Seven 
Grand, the whiskey bar in University 
City. Will I have to give OkCupid 
another shot? I hope not, but I’ve seen 
so many good relationships come 
from it that it’s almost tempting. And 
what I’m most curious to find out, 
will I actually miss the LA bar scene 
while I’m here? After spending some 
quality time making small talk with 
real live adults, it makes it hard to take 
talking about “kickbacks” seriously. 

Having a taste of the 21+ LA life 
has given me this sense of urgency to 
graduate on many levels, but I know 
it’ll only take an hour after receiving 
my diploma before I start freaking 
out about post-grad life. I wouldn’t 
be shocked if I immediately started 
talking about how I wish I was still 
in freshman Dimensions of Culture 
classes (okay not really). I’m no opti-
mist but spending winter break in 
LA has sort of made me realize that I 
need to milk these last five quarters of 
college and enjoy being an undergrad. 
Once I graduate, I’ll have all the time 
in the world to chat up questionable 
people over $14 cocktails.

Taste  of  Thai  H i llcrest
527 University Ave. San Diego, CA 92103
 
When too many visits to Hi Thai have left 

one bored, an easy drive to Taste of Thai can spice 
things up. Taste of Thai doesn’t fool around with 
authenticity or prices — for $10, lunch goers can 
get two courses, and choose from favorites like 
Tom Yum and Pad Thai. For a $20 dinner, guests 
can get three courses, and might be torn over menu 
highlights such as Pork shanks sauteed with Thai 
herbs spices, chili, green peppercorns, garlic, kachai, 
lemongrass and lime leaves, and Grilled Salmon 
topped with Choochi curry sauce and shredded 
kaffir lime leaf. Dessert is simpler with either the 
choice of Homemade Non-dairy Coconut or Green 
Tea Ice Cream.

Roppongi
875 Prospect, La Jolla, CA 92037
 
Any restaurant with its own “Buddha Room” is worth 

giving a try. For those harder to convince, the Asian inspired menu 
can speak for itself. Dim Sum plus a Mini Mongolian Pulled Pork 
Sandwich is one possible $15 lunch pairing, while dinner for $30 
further excites with dishes like Crispy 
Jidori Chicken with Apple Puree and 
Persimmon Crisp with Pumpkin 
Gelato on the list to choose from. For 
those not in the mood to sit in the 
“Buddha Room,” diners can opt to sit 
outside at the chic covered patio, which 
allows for relaxed gazing out onto 
downtown La Jolla’s Prospect Street.

The  Prado
1549 El Prado, Suite 12, san diego, CA 92101
 
Balboa Park isn’t complete without The Prado: 

The restaurant’s Spanish styled design is one of the city’s 
prettiest spaces, and its Californian menu a local favorite. 
Lunch goers can start with choices like the Prado Caesar 
and pair it with a dish like the Sliced Smoked Neuskes 
Turkey Breast, together for $15. The dinner menu will 
feature starters like Spicy Calamari Fries, entrees like 
Lemongrass Scented Skuna Bay Salmon, and desserts 
like a Chocolate-
Hazelnut Mousse 
bar that comes 
with marshmal-
low ice cream, 
a three course 
meal for $30. 
Tip: Don’t miss 
the priceless after 
dinner stroll 
around the park.

whisknladle
1044 Wall St, san diego, CA 92037
 
The La Jolla gem Whisknladle is famous 

not only for its trendy vibe, but also for its taste fusions 
that borrow ingredients from all over the globe. It doesn’t 
stop with Restaurant Week, where they’ll serve a $40 
dinner that can include dishes like Roasted Cauliflower 
& Curry Brown Butter soup and Venison Pithivier with 
Celery Root Puree, roasted parsnips, shiitake and venison 
jus. Not intense enough? Try one of their equally daring 
handcrafted cocktails, such as the Durazno, a mix of 
Jalapeno Tequila, white peach and thyme ($9). 

Bleu  Boheme
4090 Adams Avenue, san diego, CA 92037
 
Kensington’s Bleu Boheme is serious about French cuisine, but visitors 

don’t need to fear the onslaught of French names that fill the menu. The rustic inte-
rior is inviting and brings guests closer to 
the kitchens in Provence. Menu items scream 
French comfort food, and dinner goers can 
have a three-course meal for $40 that includes 
traditions like Moules Provençales, Boeuf 
Bourguignon and Crepe au Creme Brulee. The 
ambiance is satiating in itself; expect to sit on 
wooden tables, soak in warm lighting and find 
French words on chalkboards covering the 
room’s brick walls.

2910 cannon st. San Diego, CA 92106
 
This well-known date spot (yes, there will be 

cutesy string lights and an outdoor patio) is making 
date night a lot less stressful. Though Point Loma isn’t 
the quickest of drives, it beats defaulting to The Bistro 
for taking out that special someone. Even the pickiest of 
dates like eating Italian, 
and for only $30, one 
gets three courses with 
a variety of Italian clas-
sics to choose from, 
like Pesto Caprese 
salad, Chicken 
Florentine and 
Tiramisu. If an earlier 
meal sounds better, a 
two-course lunch is 
only $10 and features 
comparable items like 
Walnut Gorgonzola 
and Lasagna.

Cafe  Coyote
2461 San Diego Avenue, San Diego, CA 92106
 
Cafe Coyote is one of Old Town’s most bustling spaces, with 

senoras effortlessly luring people in by cooking fresh tortillas out-
side, and two stories of dining space to accommodate more than 

enough tourists and locals. 
Watch out for Taco Tuesday — 
the joint can get extra packed 
because of its deals, so go early. 
They will continue the gen-
erosity throughout Restaurant 
Week by serving a $10 lunch, 
where visitors can select two 
courses like Empanadas de 
Queso Rajas and Famous Old 
Town Carnitas, while dinner 
for $20 allows for two courses 
plus a dessert, like a Mousse de 
Chocolate y Chile.

$

                  D  Bar
      3930 5th Avenue, San Diego, CA 92103
 

The almost all glass 
exterior of D Bar adds curios-
ity enough for first time visitors, 
but the names of the menu items 
might add even more. Dishes like 
their Coca Cola Braised Short 
Ribs and the d = mc^2 dessert 
stray from the ordinary. For $15, 
diners can choose one “Savory” 
and one “Sweet,” and for $30, a 
starter is included for a complete 
three-course meal. Guests might also get to see co-owner and 
Executive Pastry Chef Keegan Gerhard, seen often on the Food 
Network during his off-camera time.

$$

    Flavor  Del  Mar
 1555 Camino Avenue, del mar, CA 92014
 
A good meal always tastes better with a nice view. Flavor 

Del Mar’s sleek interior hosts wide windows that lets guests look out onto 
a Del Mar street view and the Pacific Ocean 
and complements the sophisticated modern-
continental menu. Lunch goers can pay $20 
for two courses, can choose starters like 
Mexican Bay Scallop Ceviche, and to follow, 
entrees like a Double Double Prime Beef 
Burger topped with aged white cheddar, 
arugula, caramelized onion, tomato confit, 
ketchup and mayo within a brioche bun. 
For $40, an extra dessert course is offered 
where diners can indulge in sweets like a 
Butterscoth Budino, which consists of Italian 
pudding, caramel, whipped creme fraiche, 
and maldon sea salt. Every menu item is 
paired with an optional wine choice.

Restaurant Week is one of San Diego’s signature bi-annual events —a six-day, foodie frenzy that 
accommodates all palates and budgets, where over 160 restaurants offer some of their best dishes to the 

public for a price that won’t break the bank.

Eureka!  Gourmet  Burgers  and  Craft  Beer
RESTAURAnT    REvIEW SITE  SCEnE

Haute La Jolla Nights

Eureka! Gourmet Burgers and 
Craft Beer is putting a sophisticated 
twist on the classic American favorite. 
Jonny Barr, Eureka! whiskey connois-
seur, considers the restaurant to be a 
family business, with the same four 
owners wildly expanding to seven 
locations in just three years. The 
newest home for Eureka! is set in the 
newly renovated University Town 
Center, conveniently close to campus 
and students who may be craving a 
hand-picked whiskey after class. 

The eatery boasts 40 craft beers on 
tap, 15 of which are constantly chang-
ing, as well as all-natural beef from 
100 percent vegetarian fed, hormone 
and antibiotic free cows. All of the 
sauces are made in house to assure 
freshness. The restaurant features a 
clean-contemporary style enveloped 
with dark wood, which gives the 
place a cozy feel. The intimate bar is 
separated from the dining area by a 
partial divider, while the dining area 
connects to the outside patio, creating 
a large open environment. 

For Starters!, as the Eureka! menu 
enthusiastically shouts everything 
with an exclamation point, the Eureka 
Truffle Fries platter ($7.75) is the 
french fry made decadent, infused 
with truffle oil, layered with melted 
havarti cheese and garnished with 
green onions. The truffle oil and mild 
cheese create a balanced flavor to 
the saltiness of the potato and is the 
essential choice for starters. For the 

meat lovers, the Osso Buco Riblets 
($8.95) may be the more appropriate 
appetizer, with juicy Red wine braised 
pork tossed in a firecracker aioli. The 
menu also includes a unique selection 
of salads, like the Your Mama’s 80’s 
Style Taco Salad ($11.25), topped with 
unexpected “old school” Fritos, and 
the San Diego Caesar Salad ($15.25), 
which highlights San Diego’s close 
proximity to the ocean with blackened 
jumbo scallops, crunchy green apples 
and croutons finished off with shaved 
parmesan. 

The Eureka! Burgers are influ-
enced by various places, such as the 
Catalina Bison Burger ($14.95), paired 
with charbroiled tri-peppers and 
Bermuda onions, smoked mozzarella 
and a savory bacon infused jalapeno 
jam. The Napa Burger ($11.25) is 
joined with oil and vinegar marinated 
oven-roasted Roma tomatoes, havarti, 
pesto aioli and arugula topped with 
fried pancetta — a must try for those 
who can appreciate a double serving 
of meat, with beef and salt cured pork 
belly. For the self-indulgent, the side 
of signature Kennebec potato fries 
may be substituted for Sweet Honey 
Cinnamon potato fries or Panko 
Crusted onion rings (additional 
$1.25). The Panko crust provides a 
satisfying bite. Eureka! also caters to 
the health nut or vegetarian patrons 
by offering turkey or veggie patties 
in lieu of  beef, as well as a Naked 
Burger — the option of a bed of aru-
gula tossed in lemon vinaigrette rather 
than a fresh-baked bun. 

Barr let UCSD students in on a 
few tips to enjoying a nice glass of 
whiskey during a private tasting for 
The Guardian. Barr describes the 
varieties of whiskey to be like the 
wine family, from Bourbon to Wheat, 
Single Malt, Wry, Unaged, Corn, Irish 
and Scotch. Barr advised that the best 
way to capture the complex flavors 
is to take a tiny sip, let the whiskey 
slowly move to the back of the tongue, 
then open to exhale the different notes 
of the liquor. 

All of the whiskeys at Eureka! have 
been hand-selected from a small batch 
of American distilleries across the 
nation. Eureka! has meticulously cho-
sen a vast array of whiskey to satisfy 
any palette. The Four Roses bourbon 
is one of the oldest whiskeys and car-
ries a strong and spicy flavor. Then 
there is the Rasputin Hopped whiskey, 
which bears more of a piney flavor. 
For the whiskey newcomers, Barr sug-
gests the Chatoe Rogue single malt 
that delivers a lighter taste and is also 
referred to as the “American Jamison.” 
Barr’s beverage of choice is the Old-
Fashioned, which is composed of Wry, 
bitters, orange zest and a sugar cube.  

Eureka! is a great place to splurge 
after a stressful exam. The food cre-
ates a decadent escape from other 
casual, greasy burger joints, and their 
whiskey selection is a nice change 
from the many San Diego restau-
rants, which feature beer and wine. 
However, beware of becoming too 
self-indulgent, otherwise the pricey 
tab will certainly add up.

Imagine this: a yellow bike. And 
four wheels. Now think teamwork 
like a tandem because you just added 
16 passengers, and everyone is pedal-
ing. But there is a table in the middle 
so the passengers are facing inward, 
and still pedaling. Put a roof over 
everyone’s head and give them bar-
stools as seats. Maybe even a drink or 
two because, hell, you have a table in 
front of you. Voila, the Dutch Social 
Cycle. If this is not reason enough to 
check out the Haute La Jolla Nights, 
remember that most of everything in 
this string of three nights is free. Yes, 
free, and this does not entail waiting 
in line for over an hour to get a sad 
piece of brown that they call “burger,” 
because this is La Jolla, the bougiest 
place on earth. 

The nights of Jan. 24 to Jan. 26 
have become a demonstration of 
the culture and lifestyle of native La 
Jollans. Live music from 20+ bands 
amp up the streets of the Village of 
La Jolla. Art galleries open their arms 
and doors and welcome guests to new 
collections. Past artists like renowned 
Graffitist Jesse James Reno have 
come out for a live demonstration of 
mural painting. Local shops decide to 

stay open past sunset and whip out 
their creativity in exhibits showcas-
ing the owner’s talents. Adelaides 
has floral arrangement demonstra-
tions, Geppetto’s host arts and crafts 
for those who cannot legally drink, 
and Warwick’s makes it’s very own 
“Beerimisu”. What is a Beerimisu? 
Heaven. Or sultry tiramisu infused 
with rich, dark craft brews.

Coinciding with the Farmers 
Insurance Open, the Haute La Jolla 
Nights come as the after party to a 
day out on the range and closes the 
golf tournament. Reflecting other 
towns’ events, the La Jolla Village 
Merchants Association created this 
annual event to make La Jolla one of 
those “nightlife hotspots.” Festivities 
begin at 4 p.m. and rage on until 9 
p.m. Despite the current weather of 
what some Californians refer to as 
“cold” and despite the fact that this 
event is not exactly walking distance 
from campus, Haute La Jolla Nights 
is an iconic scene. The atmosphere 
becomes alive as people explore shop 
to exhibit to eatery and ambient 
music accents this journey. And who 
knows, maybe you can slip a glass 
of champagne to top off the night 
because there is nothing like staying 
classy in San Diego.

Halcyon Days By Christie Yi

Dear Editor, 
In a recent letter to the Guardian, 

Professor Rosaura Sánchez 
(Literature), Luis Martin-Cabrera and 
Charles Thorpe (Sociology) stated: 
“Last week, Gaza was subject to eight 
days of bombardment. In response, 
Hamas sent multiple rockets into 
Israel and killed five Israelis.”  The 
eight days of bombardment referred 
to the operation “Pillars of Defense,” 
which Israel carried out between 
November 14-21 in response to 
unrelenting rocket attacks from Gaza 
by the terror organizations Hamas 
and Islamic Jihad, both of whom 
are openly committed to eradicating 
Israel. Sanchez et al., provide no 
evidence for their cause-and-effect 
version of the violence, which is not 
surprising since none exists outside 
perhaps a parallel universe where 
time flows in reverse. 

If readers want to know which 
version of events is accurate, they 
need only Google the keywords 
“Gaza” and any date just prior to the 
start of Israel’s eight-day campaign 
and they will find an ample amount 
of news reports of rocket fire from 
Gaza into Israel and Israel’s warnings 
to Hamas to cease and desist. For 
example on Nov. 12, Reuters news 
service reported “Gaza militants 
launched 10 rockets into southern 
Israel by midday Monday… The 
barrage ramps up pressure on the 
Israeli government to stage a large-
scale operation aimed at stopping the 
persistent attacks.” A press release 
by the French government stated, 
“France strongly condemns the firing 
of rockets from Gaza targeting the 
population of southern Israel.”  So 
how could Hamas’ rocket attacks 
be in response to Israel’s 8-day 
operation, as Sanchez et al. claim, 

if they were occurring before the 
start of that operation?  In fact, in 
the 10 months leading up to Israel’s 
Nov. 14 military operation, over 
800 rockets had been fired into 
Israel. Here is President Obama’s 
take on who started the violence 
from his press conference on Nov. 
18, 2012: “Let’s understand what the 
precipitating event here was that’s 
causing the current crisis, and that 
was an ever-escalating number of 
missiles that were landing not just in 
Israeli territory but in areas that are 
populated.” He added, “[T]here is no 
country on earth that would tolerate 
missiles raining down on its citizens 
from outside its borders. So we are 
fully supportive of Israel’s right to 
defend itself from missiles landing on 
people’s homes.” 

Likewise, leaders of Canada, 
UK, Germany, France, the EU and 
just about every other democratic 
country supported Israel’s operation 
as a legitimate act of self-defense. 
Sanchez et al. also decry Israel’s 
blockade of Gaza but ignore the fact 
that it was implemented in 2007 only 
after the takeover of Gaza by Hamas 
and subsequent attacks on Israeli 
citizens launched from Gaza. They 
also claim it is illegal but a recent 
UN investigation concluded that it 
was, in fact, perfectly legal under 
international law as “a legitimate 
exercise of the right of self-defense” 
(see UN Palmer report). Shame on 
Sánchez, Martin-Cabrera and Thorpe 
for trying to alter facts to fit their 
well-known political views on the 
Jewish state.

LETTER To THE EDIToR

Recent Letter Presented 
Skewed Version of Events

If  Those Wishes Weren’t Ambitious Enough, Here Are A Few More

A.S. Council to be more accountable for how it 
spends its money. 
A.S. slashed student org funding from $500 to $100 over 
the course of one year. Although A.S. has stopped spending 
an entire year’s worth of tuition on the printing of single 
magazine issues, it still has a way to go before digging itself 
out of debt. 

Greek housing and more fun at UCSD in general.
Greek housing is not an outlandish request — it is actually 
absurd that we don’t have something so fundamental to the 
college experience. This will lead to more fun on campus 
because suddenly it won’t feel like such a disjointed ghost 
town (thanks, six-college system).

Replace Cafe Roma with another coffee place.
Cafe Roma serves you exactly what you brew up in your 
dorm microwave, except next to a lovely set of wooden 

tables. Rumor has it that it is on the way out, so we hope 
for a Starbucks or a Peet’s Coffee — or really anything with 
quality control.

More love for our co-ops.
Soon, Price Center will open a salon. While convenient for 
those unwilling to step foot off campus for a haircut, the 
prospect of building a social community around a giant 
shopping mall is a bit dismal, particularly considering the 
poor financial condition of our beloved co-ops. 

Last but not least, more reader feedback for 
The Guardian.
As you may have noticed, we’ve been making a lot of 
changes to The Guardian, both in terms of the content and 
visuals. For example, we started a new section, Weekend, 
and redesigned the front page. While we’re happy with the 
direction the paper is going, we always want more feedback 
from our readers. Let us know what you think of these 
changes and more by emailing opinion@ucsdguardian.org.

UCSD 
Volleyball: 
Small Fish 
in Big Pond

rachel  uda ruda@ucsd.eduqueen  of  kings

UCSD head coach Kevin Ring is 
well aware that to bring a knife to 
a gunfight is ill-advised. Of course, 
he has no choice in the matter, 
as UCSD Men’s Volleyball, after 
season, remains the only Division-
II team in a Division-I conference. 

Competing in the 12-team 
Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation among schools that 
count expenditures in the tens of 
millions, UCSD’s presence in the 
conference may seem like an odd 
clerical error left uncorrected, but 
it’s just the byproduct of a sport 
left underrepresented. There are 22 
NCAA Division-I men’s volleyball 
teams in the country, 13 NCAA 
Division-II teams and 47 NCAA 
Division-III teams. Compare that 
to the 347 NCAA Division-I men’s 
basketball teams and the 358 
NCAA Division-II men’s basketball 
teams. When looking at those 
numbers, the first thing that stands 
out is the obvious discrepancy in 
size. But the second is that men’s 
volleyball bucks the trend of 
increasing the number of programs 
at the Division-II level, notable 
because a small-budget sport 
like men’s volleyball should seem 
appealing to small-budget schools.

In any case, this leaves schools 
like UCSD at a major disadvantage, 
as organizers have chosen to lump 
Division-I and Division-II teams 
together. The decision may provide 
Division-II teams with a regular 
season, but hardly ever lends 
itself to Division-II postseason 
appearances. In 2005, the UCSD 
men’s volleyball team went 2–24, 
fell to 2–27 the following year and 
has made steady improvement 
since, topping out at 13–15 in 2009.

Needless to say, the men’s 
volleyball team has never qualified 
for the conference finals, but it has 
shown marked improvement within 
the past four seasons or so. Credit 
UCSD’s program, which seems 
to have figured a way to recruit 
talent that goes unseen by their 
big Division-I competitors. Junior 
starting middle blocker Sebastian 
Brady acknowledges the difficulties 
for a program with very little 
money to offer potential athletes. 
Brady figures the coaching staff 
makes do by looking outside of 
regions well known for talent (like 
Los Angeles and Orange County), 
instead picking up players who may 
fly under the radar, like Garrett 
Dempsey (Illinois) and Kevin 
McGinnis (Missouri). 

Ever the underdog — the 
Tritons were picked to finish dead 
last in the MPSF this season — 
UCSD seems to have the cut of 
a team that could break above 
.500, or even make a playoff run. 
Brady believes UCSD may play the 
spoiler in 2013, with every player 
from last season’s roster returning, 
including Vaun Lennon and Carl 
Eberts, two players acknowledged 
at the national level for their 
performances in 2012.

If for nothing else but the 
chance to see another upset like 
UCSD’s win against UCLA last 
season, I would sneak a men’s 
volleyball game in this season. 
Everyone likes an underdog, and 
nothing says underdog like UCLA’s 
66 million dollars to UCSD’s 7.3 
million.

Cal State Stanislaus
Cal State Stanislaus has fallen into a midseason slump. The Warriors have lost 

their last three games, falling to San Francisco State and Sonoma State by single-
digit margins, after getting blown out by Chico State 48–86.

“Stanislaus is another team that’s very well-coached, and they always do a 
very good job of scouting and figuring out what you’re going to do,” Carlson said. 
“I think we need to set a tone early on and establish a presence, and force them 
to play our speed and our style.”

Although Stanislaus carries the same 1–5 record, the Tritons may have 
trouble matching up with the much larger Warrior lineup. Stanislaus touts a 
number of forwards well-past 6-foot-6, who may prove to be a problem for the 
smaller Triton roster. Look for senior shooting guard Tyler McGrath to produce 
from the perimeter. The guard is UCSD’s top-scorer, averaging 16 points a game.

Chico State
Chico State, picked to win the conference in the annual CCAA Preseason 

Coaches Poll, is currently tied for third in the CCAA standings, with a 4–2 CCAA 
record and 7–3 overall record. The Wildcats will look to continue their four-game 
winning streak this Friday against the Tritons.

Last season, Chico State was crowned the regular season champion, during 
which it finished 25–8 and made its first appearance at the NCAA Division II 
Tournament for the first time in five years. This season, the Wildcats return junior 
guard Damario Sims to run the point. The guard earned All-CCAA honors along 
with All-West Region honors and is sure to push the UCSD backcourt this Friday.

“Sims is very good, and he will pose problems for us this weekend,” UCSD 
head coach Chris Carlson said. “He’s athletic, well-coached, and he’s on a team 
that’s always very well-prepared.”

The Tritons went up against Chico State twice last season, losing once in early 
January and again in February.

“[Chico] always does a good job defensively,” Carlson said. So we’re going to 
work hard on getting open and not turning the ball over so that we can give our-
selves chances to score. I think in our last couple games we have been turning the 
ball over a lot, and that’s been a big problem for us.”

The UCSD Men’s Basketball is set to face Chico State and Cal State Stanislaus 
at RIMAC this Friday and Saturday, Jan. 10-11.

UCSD Guard Osga Records 1,000 Career Points

This weekend, Jan. 10 to Jan. 11, the UCSD Men’s Basketball team will face 
CCAA opponents Chico State and Cal State Stanislaus for the first time this 
season. UCSD goes into this weekend with a 1–5 record in conference, a 2–7 
record overall, needing a win to pull itself out of from last place, where it sits 
tied with both Humboldt State and Cal State Stanislaus.

womEn's  bAskEtbALL

Senior guard Emily Osga was 
unaware of how close she was to hit-
ting the 1,000-point milestone going 
into the game against Humboldt 
State last Saturday, Jan. 5.

“I made a jumper, and my par-
ents were going crazy. I just thought 
it was because we were winning, 
and then they told me that I had 
hit the 1,000 mark,” Osga said. “I 
thought that was pretty cool.”

Osga, a biology major whose 
humility kept her from speaking 
much more on her 1,000-point 
achievement, has started at the 2 
position for the Tritons for the past 
three seasons. The senior should 
be considered one of UCSD’s most 
dangerous all-around players, big 
for a guard and yet still fast, with a 
reach that makes her a presence on 
the boards and hard to get past on 
the dribble.

Despite the strength of her all-
around game, Osga says she would 
still like to become better on the 
defensive end. “I’d like to work on 
getting more done on defense,” 
Osga said. “I want to be a defensive 
stopper.” In her senior season, Osga 
has logged the most minutes and 
steals on the squad and is averaging 
over five rebounds a game. She is 
the second-highest scorer behind 
fifth-year senior Daisy Feder, who 
also reached the 1,000-point mark 

earlier this season. The two seniors 
lead the team in all categories: steals, 
points, three-pointers, rebounds, 
blocks and assists. 

“I’ve come a long way as a player 
and as a person,” Osga said. “But get-
ting to play with Daisy [Feder] for 
another year is a blessing, though, 
she does so much for the team.”

The Tritons currently sit behind 
Chico State in the CCAA standings, 
in which they are tied for second 
place with Cal State Los Angeles. 
UCSD is scheduled to face No. 6 
Chico State this Friday at 5:30 p.m. 
at home. 

Osga says the team is ready to 
take on the undefeated Wildcats 

later in the week.
“This year, [Chico’s] the unde-

feated one, and we want to break 
their streak,” Osga said.  “We know 
they’re gonna come to play, and we 
just need to play hard.”
