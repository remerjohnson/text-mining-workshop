Yes, what we see in the movies does happen in real 
life. Today",; a ' the Supreme Court begins its new 
term, a new justice will sit on the bench, the 105th 
justice in the Court" 192 year history. That justice, 
Sandra Day O'Connor is quite different from the 104 
justices that have preceeded her; she is a woman. 

In the midst of uncertainty about his economic 
programs, a fu ror over AWACS sales to Saudi Arabia, 
and dismay over the policies of his Interior Secretary, 
Ronald Reagan's appointment of O'Conner stands out 
as possibly the most positive action the President has 
taken in his 8 months in office. There has been a call 
for a woman to be placed on the high court for many 
year ' . It is indeed ironic that a man so vehemently 
opposed to a Constitutional guarantee for women's 
rights would strike a blow in favor of those rights by 
putting a woman in the chambers that decide how to 
defend Constitutional rights. But regardless , Reagan 
is to be commended for the decision. 

As Justice O'Connor begins her term on the 
Supreme Court, many constitutional questions 
plague America that will have to be addressed. Since 
the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade (1973), the 
abortion issue has become more visible, emotional 
and divisive. The Court' . views on abortion will need 
to be reviewed and clarified to aid in the debate of the 
issue. Guarantees of First Amendment rights in the 
areas of press restraints have been threatened by 
recent Congressional security statutes. The whole 
body of law on criminal and civil right · still looms 
over the Court. In short , the Court faces great work 
ahead. We hope that the work of Jus tice O'Connor on 
the Court concerning these issues will be as of as 
much historical significance as the mere fact tha t she 
is on the Court. 

On this Firs t Monday in October , we hope you wi ll 
send your thoughts and bles 'ings to Sandra 
O'Connor. Welcome to the Supreme Court.

Glen and Sheare r 

Watching those nasty soaps 
Wander across most college 

campuse during the after-
noon and you may wonder 
where the students have gone. 
Something like a 'iesta sets in 
after lunch. 

Most likely you 'll find the 
students jammed into lounges 
and common rooms watching 
television melodramas. Such 
programs a s "All My 
Children" and "Search for 
Tomorrow" are so popular 
that some students schedule 
their classes so as not to miss a 
single episode. 

"Before the end of the first 
week of classes I'd lost half a 
dozen students to 'General 
Hospital, '" complained speech 
Professor Nancy Buerkel· 
Rothfuss of Central Michigan 
University. "Like 5·year-olds 
who talk about Batman all day 
long, these kids talk about 
soap operas ... 

This seemingly harmless 
campus fad is no joke. Unlike 
middl e-aged viewers, younger 
viewer ' may lack the wisdom 
to take " the soaps" with a 
grain of salt. 

Professor Buerkel·Rothfu s' 
startl ing dropout rate moved 
her to su rvey 290 CMU 
s tud e nt s las t year to 
determine the effects of 'oaps 
on young people . She learned 
that those who watch soaps 
regularly think such programs 
are t rue to life. I n other words 
view is distorted . 

Students who watch soaps 
every day, for example, tend to 
overestimate the average 
number of American women 

who are doctors. Most people 
guess that one in 10 is a 
physician , but soap lovers say 
'omewhere between five and 

six have been to medical school 
(the actual figure is well below 
one). 

[n addition , soap addicts 
overstate the average number 
of divorces, illegitimate births 
and extramarital affairs in 
America. 

Of course, judging from the 
contents of most soaps, this 
exaggerated view isn ' t 
unreasonable. In a six-month 
period, anot her professor 
recorded on one program: 
"eight divorces, two bigamous 
marriages, four separations, 
six pending divorces and 21 
couples living or s leeping 
together out of wedlock." 

Under such trashy influ· 
ence, it 's not surprising that 
collegiate soap addicts might 
feel inadequate if they neglect 
to sleep with three different 
people in one week. 

We don 't pretend to be the 
Legion of Decency. Yet the 
problem with taking soaps 
seriously is that real life and 
telev ision ar en 't sy non ymous. 
[n fact, our lives can 't rival 
that of Erika on "All My 
Children." [n our neighbor· 
hood, weeks go by wit hout so 
much as a tingleof excitement. 
Nor are our friend s as 
consistently beautiful as the 
tight circle of guys and dolls on 
"The Edge of Night." 

Perhaps that 's why soaps 
have lots to offer the college 
crowd . At a time when 

personal relationships can be 
difficult to forge and parents 
are far away, it 's easy to rely 
on the Cybils, Mark ', Betsys 
and Wall ys of daytime 
television. Most of the primary 
characters are in their 20s and 
s eem as wort hy of study as any 
piece of Shakes pearean 
criticism. 

As you might guess, the 
explo s ive relation s hip s 
portrayed on the tube can 
become an easy su bstit ute for 
deep friendship. By indulging 
in the endless troubles and 
shortlived resolutions of each 
episode, young viewers can 
eas ily forget worldly concerns. 
And it's a snap to regard 
certain characters as mentors, 
models or soul mates. rt all 
adds up to trouble. 

While college life can 
re s emble an unhealthy 
"Peyton Place ," it rarely 
maintains the emotional level ' 
of "As the World Turns." 
Nevertheless , young adult · 
can harm themselves and 
others by confus ing their 
world wi t h th e br eezy , 
bed hopping game played out 
each aft ernoon on mos t 
channels. 

We u nd e rs l and man y 
college students turn the dial 
for lack of better things 10 do. 
Their parents do much the 
same. But it 's ironic that 
s tudents who complain that 
academic institutions don 't 
prepare them for the real 
world also waste away their 
afternoons in the television 
lounge.

Unfortunately for the AS, 
this little scenario will never 
happen, although they would 
like to think so. Like AS 
Councils of the past, the 
present AS concerns itself 
with issues that have little 
bearing on the lives of 
students and ignores issues 
that might possibl y make life 
here at UCSD more tolerable. 

No one off ·campus is going 
to be affected by the AS Coors 
boycott - for that matt er no 
one on campu!-. wi ll be eit her. 

The boycott is completely non· 
binding to AS organizations or 
anyone elseon campus. In fact, 
Coors was consumed by some 

. of the members of theaudience 
at the last AS Council meeting. 
Students won't drink Coors 
because of its "Colorado 
pisswater" taste, not because 
their "student leaders" have 
decided to boycott it. 

Anyone observing AS 
politics over the past few years 
realizes that in general. the 
council is power hungry . Since 
it lack ' any real power of it s 
own. the AS Council invents 
little schemes like the Coors 
boycott to soothe their egos. 
These exercise" in im aginary 
power don' t hUrl anyond s ince 

no one listens anyhow), but 
while the AS is so caught up 
wit h uncontrollable external 
affairs , they leave no time for 
the one thing they actually 
have power over: i.e. the 
dispersal of $157,000 of the 
students' money in a manner 
which reflects the views of the 
majority of students, not just 
the loudest. But, as could be 
expected, this year's "serious" 
AS, under the leaders hip of 
Jules Bagneris, has confronted 
issues it can 't cont rol and 
forgott en the students it 
represents. Anyone who was 
left dry·cupped at the last TG 
after 40 minutes of beer flow 
knows what [' m talking about. 

The AS show~ no s igns of 
changing its ag old ways. It 's 

still squan dering stu den ts' 
money. If you have nothing 
better to do on Wednesday 
night. go see the AS in action 
and have a good laugh. On the 
agenda is a proposal to fund 
Jules' "fact-finding" trip to an 
east coast sorority house. 

A word of cautIOn to Nestle. 
It seems that they are next on 
the AS Council boycott hit 
parade. If they are not careful 
they could be wiped out , and 
Hershey could make a killing. 
Who knows, maybe if they 
have time, they will vote on a 
proposal to end world hunger.

Uranium boomtown goes bust 
B~a~~~~~s ~J!;L 

Lee Pittard left New Mexico 
state .government five years 
ago at age 27 to make his 
fortune bu ilding houses and 
shopping centers in t he 
ura nium boom tow n of 
Grants. These days, he st ill is 
building - in the oil boom 
region of southeast New 
Mexico. 

Ignacio "Nacho" Salazar, 
who immigrated to Grants 
from Mexico in 1967 and 
founded an exploratory 
drilling business with hi s 
brothers, still is drilling - for 
carbon dioxide in northeast 
New Mexico. 

Dave Zerwas, insurance 
agent and ex-mayor of Grants, 
planned to cash in on the boom 
with a subdivision of more 
than 77 homes. Today, hi s 
Western Terrace Develop· 
ment , its streets laid out, fire 
hydrants in place and utility 
cables laid underground, has 
somewhat fewer than its 
planned number of houses -
two. 

Grants, the proud "uranium 
capital of the world," is in a 
depression . 

Over the past two years, 25 
mines have closed, and of the 
26 that remain open, at least 
three are on reduced work 
schedules and produce only 
small amounts of uranium for 
stockpiling. Several others 
will close in 1982, adding to an 
estimated 2,500 jobs already 
lost in the Grants area, where 

the population has dropped 
from 15,000 to 12,500. 

Government statistics and 
the opinions of outside experts 
g i ve litt le groun d for 
o pt im ism. Nevert he less, 
tow nspeople here confidently 
predict a re-boom. "I thnk 
Reagan is for the uran ium 
industry, and it isjustlfoingto 
take a little while,' said 
Martin Allex , the city 
government's director of 
accounting. " Thi s town's 
going to make it. Uranium is 
going to come back." 

Paul Robinson, executive 
director of the Southwest 
Research and Information 
Center, an Albuquerque·based 
environmental protection 
organization, believes that 
Grants has been misused by 
the uranium companies. 
"They are not interested in the 
town," he charged . "They are 
interested in their workers 
having a town to live in while 
they are produ cing. They 
make some high -vi s ibility 
donations, but they don't 
support services - streets, 
sewers, water, schools." 

In Grants itself, there is just 
a faint echo of that criticism. 
Lee Pittard says that Hobbs, 
the oil boom town where he 
now does most of hi s business, 
is helped more by oil 
companies than Grants is by 
uranium firms . But the 
dominant attitude wa s 
expressed by the young wife of 
a miner. "The companies give 
jobs ," she said , making the 

point that their responsibility 
extends no further. While she 
cricized the conditions of city 
services, and doesn't drink tap 
water for fear it is radioactive, 
she argued that it is 
government's responsibility to 
make improvements. 

A uranium company 
executive tacitly acknow-
ledged that his industry has 
some unmet responsibility to 
the town . But F. Steve 
Mooney , executive vice 
president of Gulf Mineral 
Resources, a division of Gulf 
Oil now developing the world 's 
deepest uranium mine at Mt. 
Taylor near Grants, said: 

"Th~re just has n 't been the 
kind of profit stru ct ure that 
would all ow (uranium ) 
companies to do some of the 
things they would like to do." 

When the uranium industry 
began , the US government 
was its sole customer, under 
long·term contrac ts that 
provided a comfortable return 
to suppliers_ Then in the 
1960 's the go ve rnment 
curtailed bu ying, topping 
altogether in 1970. The 
uranium industry - and 
Grants - suffered for a few 
year ' . 

But shortl y thereafter, with 
nuclear power seen as the 
wave of the future , the market 
started to boom. In April 1976 
the price of uranium reached 
$40 a pound. In 1970 it had 
been about $6. 

Those were high times in 
Grants: The average uranium 

industry salary hit $30,000 a 
year , miners and hustlers 
flocked to the town , and it was 
almost easier to find uranium 
than an empty hotel room. 
Pittard did $1 million worth of 
business his first year there. 

Looking back, Gulf 
Mineral's Mooney conceded 
that among uranium produ-
cers, "there was probably 
some overoptimism about the 
uranium market." The rest of 
the nuclear indu try made the 
same mistake, he added. 

Though th e pri ce of 
uranium failed to r ise after 
1976 in real dollar term. and 
then dropped in the wake of 
the 1979 Three Mile Island 
di saster , " th e u r anium 
industry kept gearing up and 
it' s almost as if the sellers 
totally took their eyes off the 
c u sto m e r s ," s ai d on e 
profes ' ional uranium watcher 
and nuclear power advocate. 

Still, the people of Grants 
are reluctant to join in the 
crit icis m . As ked if t he 
co m pan ies m ig h t have 
mis judged the fu t ure of 
uranium , city official Marti n 
Allex responded . "No, these 
are big compan ies. They'vegot 
their own thing tanks. They'd 
be cutting t hei r own throat to 
do that. " 

Despite industry pred ic· 
tions, however, the market did 
fal\. And when companies' 
throats were cut, Grants bled . 
The pu bli c chool system 
already has laid off 25 teachers 
and 20 aides and cu ·todians, 

as enrollmen t dropped from 
the peak of 5,900 in 1978·79 to 
less than 5,200 this year. 
Bu s ine ss men s ay that 
bankruptcies are common . 
Suppliers have tightened 
credit tenns on the surviving 
enterprises . There is an 
apartment vacancy rate of 
more than 30 percent , 
compared to 9.2 percent one 
year ago. 

Though there is talk in 
Gran ts of broadening the 
town's economic base, nothing 
yet has come of it. The area 
once was a major carrot 
producer - unt il mining 
companie bought up water 
rights. 

US Senator Harrison 
Schmidt (R·N.M.) told a town 
meeti ng in Augu t that the 
uranium industry can turn 
around in five year . The 
Grants Daily Beacon called 
that foreca t "bad new ," but 
the real picture may be even 
worse. 

T he overall consumption of 
electr icity in the United States 
has risen only two to three 
percent a year since the 1973· 
74 oil embargo. For decades 
before, t he ann ual growth rate 
had been seven percent. That 
is one reason why utilitie 
have been cancell ing nuclear 
reactor construction orders. In 
1973, accor ding to the 
Department ot Energy, 25 new 
reactor ' were ordered . In 1979 
and 1980 the num ber was zero.

featuring Coors products. 

The reso lu t ion , whi ch 
passed 16-2, reaffirms t} ~ 
Coors boycott that has existed 
on campus since 1977, The AS 
passed a similar reaffirm at ion 
measure last Apri l. 

According to Commissioner 
of Student Welfare Reggie 
Will iams, students should 
support the boycott because of 
Coor's right-wi ng poli tica l 
beliefs and their possi ble 
unhealthy brewi ng methods. 

Wi ll iams, who submitted 
the boycott proposal, charged 
Coors with discr iminati ng 
again t mi nor iti es , unions, 
women , and people wit h 
alternative lifestyles or 
political belief that differ 
from Coors ', Because UCSD 
has women, gay and minority 
group , Williams called the 
boycott "a upportive 
response to tho e groups as 
OPPoS~? to an attack on 
Coors. 

AS President Jules Bagneri ' 
supports the boycott. citing 
concern for the health of the 
students. "The social 
concerns (of the students) 
outweighed the economic gain 
of letting Coors on campus," 
he said . 

The major health concern 
Involves the asbestos filters 
that Coors use in its brewing 
proce s. Evidence ha shown 
a s be tos fiber s to be 
carcinogenic. Coors says it 
monitors the asbestos level of 
its beer and denie ' that 1t 
filters are unsafe. 

Another concern is that 
Coors does not pasteurize its 
beer. Unpasteurized beer 
hould be refrigerated for 

maxim um flavor, but Coors is 
allowed to it on grocery 

shelves for up to 60 days. The 
company says that although a 
60 day period can weaken the 
beer's taste, it does not affect 
the safety of the beer. 

Williams said the AS needed 
to reaffirm the boy cot t to make 
people aware of t he issue, and 
to dissuade them from buying 
Coors. 

The issue was revived when 
the Recreation Club consi-
dered usi ng Coors to sponsor 
its upcoming Oktoberfest. 

After talks with AS Council 
mem bers, the c\ u b decided not 
to accept Coors' sponsorship. 

A nation-wide boycott of 
Coors products began in 1977 
when union members of 
Brewery Workers Local 366, 
and the AFLICIO went on 
str ike, claiming that Coors did 
not support the union. Joining 
the union's boycott were 
minority groups and advocate ' 
of gun cont rol, ERA, abortion, 
environmental issues and gay

Union members accused 

Coors of discriminating 
against minorities and 
women, and using polygraph 
tests to question employees' 
personal beliefs. Reacting to 
these accusations, Coors 
published a pamphlet in 1978 
to discredit "the falsehoods 
and half-truths" propagated 
by the union . [n 1979 Coor 
decertified the union , 

be t reco rd s of hiring 
minorities and women. More 
than 13 percent of its total 
work force are minorities, it 
stated, and 17 percent are 
women, 

According to the pamphlet, 
polygraph tests are required of 
all job applicants. The tests 
were initiated for "security 
reasons," and are similar to 
r.ractices of many companies.

Cultural a wareness was 
once again brought to UCSD 
during the fourth a nnual 
Cultu r a l Unity Day of 
Awareness Fest ival held last 
Friday at t he Mandeville/ 
Student Center Quad. 

In thi s cultural event, guest 
s peakers di sc ussed th e 
importance of ethniC coalItIOn 
and at tacked some of the racial 
prob l ems in the US . 
Additionall y, performances by 
ethnic groups entertained the 
small audience. 

Asian·American Students 
Alliance. and United American 
Indian Students. chos e 
"Progress through Cultural 
Unity" as this year's theme. 

Conrado Gerardo. one of the 
festival founders. said CUDA 
should be " a vehicle to educate 
the general s tudent population 
on the political . economic, 
cultural and educational 
s truggles that are universa l in 
all Third World people in this 
·ociety." But students don't 
seem to b intere ·ted in 
multiracial events such as the 

CUDA Festival as they are In 
the TG1Fs, explained Gerardo. 

The AS allocated $1 ,625 for 
the Festival; the Univers ity 
Events Office contributed 
$500; and Revelle, Third and 
Warren Colleges donated $100 
each. The Muir Programming 
Board declined to contribute 
any fund s. 

One reason the Muir Board 
did not contribute i that their 
money is to be spen t 
exclusively on Muir students. 
Howeve r, some Muir students 
have participated in cultural 
organizations such as the 

CUDA Committee, sai d 
Gerardo. 

, 

Not everyone approves of 
the festival. " It's ridiculous 
that the AS spends some of its 
funds for an event like this," 
said one student. "The EECS 
Dept. would have been able to 
afford at least a cheap 
printer!" he added . 

Although there i some 
opposition to cultural events 
such as the CUDA festi val, the 
CUDA Committee wants to 
establi h the annual festival 
as a tradition at UCSD.

'The situation right now is 
that Ethnic Studies Programs 
are definitely under attack in 
most universities," said Erick 
Nakano, Asian Student Union 
Representative fr om UC 
Berkeley . 

Ethnic Studies Programs in 
colleges nat ionwide have 
declined du e to severe budget 
cutbacks. As a result, 50 
percent of the ethn ic studies 
programs est abli s hed in 
colleges across the coun try in 
the earl y 70's no longer exist.

Greenfield and one part·time

Diablo reactor: once it's 
irradiated, it's allover 

BY MARK SEECOF 
For t he past few weeks , a 

n ice li ttle chunk of th e 
California coast line (t he sor t of 
area that gets considered for a 
na ture preserve) has been the 
object of mas ive publ ici ty . 

What dist ingui shes t his site 
is the presence of the Diablo 
Canyon Nuclear Generating 
Station. The reason for all the 
attention is the presence of a 
dem o n st ra t i o n aga i n s t 
nuclear power in general , and 
the Diablo Canyon plant in 
particular. 

What has precipi tated t his 
protest? Not the mere 
presence of the plant - it's 
been around for about ten 
y ea r s. Not th e s udde n 
knowledge of a dangerous 
fault line beneath the plan t; 
that is a lso old news. 

No, what has brought t his 
li ttle area in to the spotlight 
has nothing to do wit h its 
feat ure or terrai n, but rather 
with t he incipient actions of 
the power plan t's masters . 

From a finished but idle 
pla n t, Dia blo Ca nyon is 
schedul ed to become an 
operating power stat ion. T he 
reason for t his may seem 
unclear. T here is, at this t ime, 
no demand at a \l for t he 
elect r icity the plant could 
provide. Existing generati ng 
facilities are more than able to 
handle current needs. Since it 
is cons iderably more expen-
sive to run the plan t than to 
leave it idle, and no new 
revenues from the sale of 
elect r ic ity can reasonabl y be 
expected , it w ould seem 
logica l, at the very least, to 
keep t he station cold un ti l 
some demand exists for its 
megawatts. Besides, it's a hell 
of a lot safer that way. 

The ut ility compan ies , 
though , are not pursuing this 
obvious course. Instead they 
are rus hing ahead to light the 
nuclear fire. Part of thi s mig ht 
just be inertia - they've 
fough t for .the right to start up 
the plant for so long that they 
may be unable to check their 
headlong rush in to the atomic 
fu rnace. 

But in reality, this motive 
vanishes against the larger, 
more important objectives of 
the utilities . Perm i t a 
momentary digress ion. 

All power plants work on the 
principle of converting heat to 
electrical current. The source 
of the heat can be an ything 
from the sun to hot magma 
close to the earth 's surface. 
The usual means, however, is 
combus tion-burni ng some· 
thing(coa l,oi l,wood,ga ,etc.). 
In a nuclear power plan t, the 
heat comes from a reactor, 
co n tai n ing ura n ium or 
plu ton ium fi sioning in a 
chain reaction. 

That works a so: a spl itting 
u ranium ato m relea e a 
bunch of neut rons, which 
strike other uran ium atoms, 
causing them to split (relea ing 
neutrons, etc.). Other kinds of 
radiat ion are also released , and 
a lot of the neutrons (most , in 
fact) n ever h it anot he r 
uranium atom, but just fly ou t 
of the core and hi t the wall of 
the reactor. All of th is act ivity 
prod uces quite a bi t of heat, 
which i u ed to make steam 
and 0 forth . 

It would be a rosy picture 
(leaving aside waste), exc pt 

for those neutrons that flew 
out of the core. This is becau se 
uranium and plutonium atoms 
aren't the only kind that split 
when neutron strike them . In 
fact, most atoms do. And when 
they split, what 's left is often 
rad io-active. When nuclear 
reactors were fi rst invented, it 
was observed that standard 
engi neering mater ials, like 
stainless s teel , simply cou ld 
not h old u p to neut r on 
bombardment , because t he 
metal' s crystalline atom ic 
structure was deranged by t he 
neutron 's effects, Exot ic 
metals, like zirconium, able to 
with stand neu t ron effects 
longer, had to be used for many 
parts. This effect of neut ron 
bombardmen t has two s ides. 
Sometimes it is desirable , such 
as for neutron activation 
analys is-where a material is 
bom barded with neutrons to 
make its constituent atoms 
radioactive so that t hey can be 
recognized by t heir radiations 
and thus the makeup of t he 
material deter mined . But 
us u ally it' s nothing but 
trouble. 

After nuclear reactors have 
been operati ng for many years, 
the reactor itself becomes so 
radioactive that t he operators 
cannot approach it. This is the 
fate of many of the US's early 
reactors . Si nce there isn't any 
good way to dea l with these old 
reactors, they are just left 
sitti ng w h e re t h ey are, 
glowing hulks in concrete 
rooms. But after a few wuks of 
operation , all reactors become 
so radioactive that they can no 
longer be disassembled and 
moved, or disposed of. Nor can 
the par ts be salvaged . 

One of the reason that 
PG& E wants so badly to run 
the Diablo Canyon reactor up 
to power, even 5 percent 
power, is that once this is 
done, all the current cries to 
ha ve i t con ve r ted to a 
conven tio n a l pl ant wi\1 
become mea ni ngless. The 
steam turbine/ generator end 
of the plant can be used with 
steam heated by oi l-fired 
boilers just as easily a with 
steam heated by a nuclear 
reactor . But once the reac tor 
has been run , the plant will be 
radioactive for good - might 
as well use it! 

There is another rea on for 
PG&E's interest in start ing up 
the plant ; the biggest reason a 
corporat ion could have: desire 
for more profit. This reason 
also deserves a backg round 
explanation. 

Private uti lity corporat ions 
are regular corporations in it 
for the money. However, as 
they fi 11 a s pecia I lot. 
providi ng services vital to all , 
they are regulated by the PUC, 
the Public Ut ilit ies Com mis-
sion. In retu rn for having a 
monopoly on providing service 
in a specified area. they mu st 
accept having their profits 
regulat ed by t he PUC , w hich 
does this by cont roll ing t he 
rates they can charge. T his is 
to protect the public from 
being gouged by a compa ny 
wit h a legal monopoly. 

The PUC w ill permit a rate 
increase for certain reason 
onl y. If a utility's cost s 
increase, then a rate increase 
wi\1 be permi t ted . Also, 
utilities are permitted rate 
increases to cover the co ts of 
constructing new plants or 
inst alling new equipment. 
Profits permitted are 
cazlcu lated on the bas is of a 
"fixed rate of return." This I 
gets very com plicated, but one 
can look at it like this: A utility 
may be permitted a margin of 
profit of 10 percent (for 
instance). That means they 
can be making $10 from every 
$100 billed. If they want to 
increase the amount of profit 
t hey ma ke (in absolute 
n um bers, not percentage 
rates, because the percentage 
is fixed), t hey have to get the 
PUC to let them raise the 
rates. They can do this only by 
building s omething tha t 
they'll have to payoff - like a 
power plant. It doesn't mat ter 
if the plant is necessary or not. 
It gets built because all of t he 
costs will be paid by ut ility 
customers, and the utility will 
get its 10 percent off the top of 
that. If bill ings are increased 
to $ 150 to cover the costs of the 
new pla nt, then the utility will 
be making $15, a greater 
amou nt. 

Once again : T he utility 
company wan ts to increase 
profits . Since the rate of profit 
is fixed (but not t he absolute 
amou nt), t he company must 
get the PUC to permit a rate 
increase. It does t his by 
build ing a pwer plan t that the 
PUC will let it raise rates to 
cover the cost of. The demand 
for t he power plant is 
secondary . 

It is true that nuclear plants 
are very expensive to bui ld and 
to operate. However, as t he 
utility company does have a 
monopoly, the amount they 
mus t charge to cover this plan t 
is not important. T He PUC, 
whose job it is to keep rates 
from getting excessive, finds 
itself authorizin,g high rates; 
and the dissatisfied customers 
can not go elsewhere. 

However, the PUC w ill not 
allow a utility to realy begin 
charging for a new power 
plant unt il it goe on· line. Thi 
is w hy PG& E i sode perate to 
warm up Diablo Canyon. It 
i n 't co t ing them anythi ng 
now, bu t they won't begi n to 
realize a profit un ti l it becomes 
active. 

The 'e are the real reason 
th a t Diablo Can y on i 
scheduled to be started up. 
PG&E want to settle the 
" pea c efu I con ver s io n " 
argument once and for all by 
irradiating t he plant ; and 
PG&E wants the profits that 
activating the plant will bring. 
It is irrelevan t to PG&E that 
the plant is dangerou , that 
runni ng it will be unneces-
ary, and that t he enormous 

cost of operating it w ill cause 
an unneeded and painfu l 
increase in t he public' . electric 
bi lls.

Volleyballers are #1 nationally 
Unbeaten Tritons continue surge toward NCAA championship 

BY COTT ALLISON 
Senior Staff Writer 

It's officia l. Last Thursday 
it was announced that UCSD's 
unbeaten women 's vo lleyba ll 
squad was the number one 
ranked CAA Division III 
team in the nation, 

The Triton ', 6·0 in league 
play this year , then showed 
their number one form by 
ripping Claremont College at 
home Friday night in three 
s traight games, 15·4, 15-10 and 
15·4. The match las ted only 
forty minutes. 

" It's getting so we just can't 
schedule learns like Claremont 
anymore." said the coach of 
UCSD's number one ranked 
team, Doug Dannevik. "We 
could easily be competitive in 
NCAA Divison II ," added 
Dannevik . 

Being ranked the number 
one team in the cou ntry is 
every team's dream. But the 
spikers aren't content to sit 
back and rest on present 
laurel - they want to prove 
that their ranking isn ' t a fluke. 
Winning the NCAA champ-
ionship this December would 
provide the proof. 

"I think we deserve it (the 
No . 1 ranking)," said 
Dannevik, "but we haven't 
really proven anything yet. We 
still have a long way to go." 

It's already been a banner 
year of sorts for the team. 
First, they've already defeated 
two NCAA Division r teams 

(It's getting so we 
just can Jt sched-
ule teams like 
Claremont any-
more. 
-Doug Dannevik 

(USF and USIU). Second, they 
recen tly crushed Azuza Pacific 
College in three straight 
games , an especially satisfyi ng 
triumph in light of th fact 
that UCSD had never before 
beaten Azuza. 

And there's more. The 
s pikers s urpri sed everyone 

la t weekend by finishing 
lhird out of a tough fie ld of 15 
teams at the La Verne 
Invitational. The Tritons have 
also won 9 st raight home 
games over the past two years. 

And now a No. I ranking in 
the NCAA. 

Much of UCSD's success 

The 
6-0 
plaYJ 

Tritons are 
zn league 

bu t the 
season lS any-
thing but over. 

comes from developing the 
right chemistry on the court. 
Quarterbacking the offense is 
Louise (Lu lu) Schwartz, whom 
Dannevik calls "a Division I 
setter." Schwartz is probably 
the Triton 's MVP so far this 
season. 

But there are players who 
are not far behind. The two 
outside-hitters, Tammy Smit 
and Kr isten Kilbourn, are 
hitting at a torrid pace. 
Dannevik keeps track of how 
often s pikes are hit for points 
or side-outs. In volleyball .300 
hitting average, like in 
baseball, is considered very 
good. Going into Friday's 
game, Smit and Kilbourn were 
hitting .480 and .410 
respectively. 

Rounding out the Triton's 
lineup is steady·playing 
Michele Whitmore at quick-
hitter , and middle-blockers 
Marilyn Horn and Vickie 
Pride. Horn is the squad's best 
defensive player and finest 
passer. 

"We don 't have a weak spot 
in our lineup," said Dannevik. 
"We have our strongest people 
in their strongest positions. 
We' re in a position we've never 
been in before, which is having 
12 or 13 good athletes." 

Complacency may be the 
s piker s ' only problem. 

" We can't let down. Our goal 
is t o win the n a tional 
championship," sa id Danne-
vik .

Men~s waterpolo makes it three straight 
BY TIM PICKWELL 

Staff Writer 
This is a season of feast or 

famine for the water polo 
Tritons. They either starve 
against strong opponents. or 
gorge upon weak ones. 

In the early part of the year 
they played tough, tourna-
ment games against national 
powers. All they could show 
for their efforts were two 
wins, one tie, a handful of 
c1ose-calls, and seven 10 ses. 

On Saturday, however, the 
Blue & Gold defeated 
Occidental College 14-5 for 
their third straight victory, as 
their record ran to 5-7- L 
Earlier in the week UCSD 
beat-up Grossmont College 20-
8. 

In the last three games, 
coach Denny Harper's squad 
has racked-up a whopping 51 
goals. Unheard of in water polo 
circles, where scores usually 

re se mble Packer s- Bears 
halftime totals_ 

Harper attributes this 
offensive prowess to anticipa-
tion and a speedy counter-
attack. The anticipation 
comt's on defense where the 
Tritons force turnovers and 
stymie opponents into wasting 
valu .l ble seconds_ 

It is the potent counter-
attal 't, however, which has 
turr ed potentially close 
conf ilcts into watery versions 
of Custer's Last Stand. 

The San Diegan's often 
begin a run on offense before 
they have the ball. As time 
runs out on an opponent's shot 
clock, several swimmers break 
away from defensive duty, 
relying on star goalie Willy 
Morri s to blanket the goal 
mouth and feed them the 
expected turnover. 

Powering these offensive 
missions are a slew of talented 

SENIORS. 

seniors. Mouse Marks totalled 
four goals against Occidental 
and had a perfect first half in 
Thursday's Grossmont 
Griffin game wit h 6 -6 
shooting. Toby Raymond has 
run-up eight goals in two 
games . Large, tough Kai 
Loedel , with two goals 
Saturday and three assists 
Thursday is generally in the 
thick of things_ 

The man who runs the show 
though, is Dan Crane, who 
plays the hole-position_ A hole-
man is akin to a basketball 
center, he must bean offensive 
threat and an adept passer. 
Crane is like Bill Walton (but 
with two good feet)_ On 
Saturday his three goals and 
six assists accounted for over 
half the-Triton's final total. 

Swift athletes like freshman 
starter Bill Kazmierowicz give 
the Triton's an extra 
dimension - speed_ The squad

Navy offers managerial positions in the following areas: 

• ELECTRONICS 

has been able to, as Harper 
puts it, "swim some teams into 
the drain _" 

Needle!:. to say, a lot of 
subs have been seeing action 
as the second-year coach has 
inserted freshmen into lop-
sided victories. They have 
played effectively, shutting 
down Grossmont in the fourth 
quarter and maintaining a safe 
second-half margin against 
Oxy. 

"Allan Cintas and Dana 
Greison have played excep-
tionally well," says Harper. 
"The freshmen have showed 
good counter-attack skills_" 

UCSD's waterpolo team 
returns to its liquid element 
Friday when tough CSU Los 
Angeles tra vels to La lalla. The 
afternoon game marks a 
temporary return to the on-
campus bathtub from the large 
Miramar pool where the team 
has a 4-1 record. 

The move to the smaller 
natatorium will cut into the 
Triton's conditioning and 
speed advantage . 

"But," assures Harper, "the 
transition should be quite 
imple." 
The energetic leader also 

promises that the LA contest 
will be exciting. 

"They have a history of 
running a freaky offense," he 
explains_ "They'll send guys 
underwater, and if we aren ' t 
alert ther,'11 pop up in front of 
the goal. ' 

Friday's game will enable 
the team to tune up for the San 
Luis Obispo Tournament 
which begins the next day_ 
The SLO tourney will also be 
held in a short pool. 

During the weekend sojourn 
to the north, UCSD will face 
several strong clubs including 
the Fresno State Bulldogs.

Intramural 
Weekend 
Spotlight 

BY LARRY GOLDMAN 
The scene was set. The first 

Guardian intramural game of 
the week matched power-
houses from the Len Dawson 
single A mens football league. 
David Crow's Shotgun Angels 
took the field against Richard 
Riedel's Deepest Penetration. 

Most teams that play single 
A play for fun but a certain 
competitiveness exists. The 
play at points is exciting 
although talent usually runs a 
little thin . 

Before the game Deepest 
Penetration was asked what 
they planned to do and in 
single A fashion they replied, 
"Cheat!" Actually, the game 
was fairly clean and in the first 
half Deepest Penetration lived 
up to their name and 
controlled the ball well . Dave 
Reim made two interceptions 
for the Penetrators . 

Unfortunately they could 
not score due to some good 
defensive play by David Crow 
and Keith Adams of Angels. 
On the other hand the Angels 
could not push the ball past 
midfield and at the end of the 
half it was 0-0. 

The most exciting play in 
the first half was when Riedel 
on a quarterback option got his 
pants ripped off -literally. At 
halftime Crow said "We will 
hopefully show you something 
this half." 

To start off the second half 
the Shotgun Angels did just' 
that by moving the ball down 
the field to score on a screen 
pa s from Crow to Eric Bolger. 
They mis ed the extra point 
and led 6-0. 

A little later in the half 
Penet ration ca me back to score 
on a run by Scott Rouse and 
the game was tied 6-6. The 
score remained that way till 
the end and the game went 
into overtime. 

In overtime each team gets 
four downs and the team who 
moves the ball furthest down 
the field is declared the 
winner . Penetration was 
pushed back and on their last 
down a desperation pa s was 
interc pled by the Angels who 
ran it back for a touchdown to 
win the game 12-6.

AtoDlicafe blends 
Dlusical styles 

BY TIM AUGUST 
Atomicafe will open it 's 

1981-82 concert season with a 
free concert at the Mandeville 
Recital Hall on Tuesday, Oct. 
6, at 8 p.m. 

This first concert will 
feature four new composer/ 
performers as well as four 
from past Atomicafe concerts. 

For those unfamiliar with 
the Atomicafe series, it is 
basically a forum for student 
composers, performers and 
artists; a place where they can 
tryout new ideas in front of an 
audience or simply perform 
works to see how people react 
to them. 

everyone. 
Lee Ray. who is assisting 

Boulanger in direct ing the 
series this season and who will 
also be performing Tuesday 
night, describes an Atomicafe 
concert as an "ongoing 
reward, one that challenges 
and will probably change your 
views about music ." He 
describes the pieces performed 
as "work that addresses 
substantive issues , not 
fulfilling a commercial 
interest. It's not music for the 
masses ." 

The series was started six 
years ago by some grad 
students and faculty member 
Jean Charles Francois who 
saw the need for an 
opportunity to exhibit their 
ideas to people other than in 
the music department. Since 
then the series has expanded 
to inc lude all kinds of 
performance and visual art a 
well as faculty and profes-

Those who have been to pas t 
Atomi cafe conce rt s are 
guaranteed an overall bet ter 
effort on all counts . 
Admittedly the series had its 
failures last year, especially in 
the technical end_ However 
thi s year the directors have 
made painstaking improve-
ments in produ ction and 
organization. A new stage 
system eliminates breaks for 
se tting up performance 
which allows for a continual 
program throughout the 
evening. Even the evening's 
program is organized toensure 
a s mo o th s equence o f 
performa nces. 

UCSD's own multi-talented Atomicafe will play a free concert tomorrow night at 
Mandeville. 

Wills: a touch of the Atlantic 
ional musicians. 
The great diversity in the 

types of performances seen at 
an Atomicafe concert allows 
for an evening of never ending 
surprise and even challenges. 
This year's director, Rick 
Boulanger, promi 'es that an 
Atomicafe Concert Hi not like 
SONO R (another UC D 
contemporary music forum ) or 
anything else you 've ever 
seen. " 

Boulanger Sire ses the fact 
that one of the most exciting 
facets of an Atomicafe concert 
is the fre exchange between 
the audience and the 
performers. "The range of 
performances extend s from 
the banal to the bizarre -
anything can happen. And, in 
response to this, the aud iences 
reaction tends to be not tame 
in some respects"." 

This is not to say that the 
concert will be unappealing by 
any mean s . Boulanger 
explains that the musical 
interests and ideas presented 
at an Atomicafe concert are so 
diverse that everyone comes 
away pleased. That is, there is 
something in every concert for 

As for th e eve ning '!-, 
pr ogram i t ~ elf , di re ct o r 
Boul anger describes i( as 
"nine pieces like night and 
day. Everyone is bound to find 
something that they will 
enjoy." Sardonically he adds, 
" ft's a great place for a firs t 
date ... You 'II have enough 
conversation 10 las t a week." 

Ce rtainl y th e mo r e 
intere (ing musical pieces will 
be the t ape and sy ntheSIzer

a performance of a composi-
tion by the French compo 'er 
Nichola Verin. Thi 
particular composition marks 
a first for Verin in that it 
features a wood-wind quin tet 
as well as a real-time digital 
synthesizer., where he has 
worked almost exclu sively 
with tape pieces sans 
traditional instuments in the 
past.

was crazy ," Will.., recalled , 
"and I thought t hat ,,()meda~ I 
would open a bookstore and 
think about how to end all 
th is. " 

After gett ing out of the 
service. Wills ret urned to 
school. He read phi losophy at 
Oxford and • oviel . tudie» at 
Columbia where he met Dr. 
Bryz in kI. He became very 
interested in arms li mitation 
and planned to work within 
that fie ld but his fa t her's 
faili ng health forced him to 
leave Wa hington and return 
to Los Angeles. Wh ile in L.A .. 
Will learned that La lollahad 
no bookstore wh ich primanly 
served UC D. He therefore 
decided to fulfill his dream of 
1969 and stan his own. 

Ha v ing wo rked i n a 
bookstore in Washington, 
Wills had acquired everal 
thousand books. These books 
he loaded into a truck and 
drove to La 101la. He drove 
around La Jolla for a few 
months before finding his 
present location . On Septem-
ber 1. 1979, D.G. Wills' Books 
and Coffee House was 
officially founded . 

Durinll its two years of 

eXI tence, the book hop ha 
co ntinued to grow In 
populanty . Will ' next plan i 
to open a second book shop· 
cuffee house directly on or 
beside the UCSD campus The 
second D G. WIlls would be 
located eIther in the tudent 
center or in the old stable· 
master's hou e at La 10lla 
Farm. The cafe would be 
open until midnight and would 
employ students . 

" I would hope it would be a 
place where people - both 
students and facultv - could 
hangout," Will added . "A 
great deal of education occurs 
when people are relaxPd and 
ju. t talki ng." To thi . effect , 
Wills ha: gone out of his way 
to give h i5 pre. ent coffee hou e 
an atmosphere conducive to 
thi type of ca. ual education. 
Amid tacks and shelves of 
books, one can relax in any 
number of comfortable and 
unusual chairs and read, talk 
or drink coffee to the soothing 
sounds of classical music. 
Wills hope a second location 
would provide a similar 
atmosphere while being even 
more accessible to those at 
UCSD.

Budget cuts threaten science, technology 

William M. Agee, chairman 
of the divers ified Bend ix 
Corp" isn't the sor t one would 
expect to hea r complaining 
about specific cuts in the 
federal budget. 

Tn addition to hosting some 
of Ronald Reagan's clo est 
aide ' on his tennis court 
during th 1980 GOP Conven· 
tion in Detroit, Agee is one of 
the president' strongest 
supporters. 

But Agee lamented to The 
Washington Post last month 
that reductions in federally· 
supported scientific re earch 
may be ill·timed an~ 
regrettable. Agee specifica lly 
noted that such cuts ~ 
affect the number of y~.' 
people who may somL~ .. 
choose science as a career, . 

While correct, Agee may not 
know how bad the situation 
already is . 

Graduate enro llments in 
p h ysics, c hemistry and 
engineeri ng have fallen nearly 
40 percent from levels of a 
decade ago. Sadly, nearly a 
third of toda y's post·graduate 
science tudent in America 
carry foreign passports. 

Last year, the National 
Center for Education 

. Statistics estimated that only 
abol:'t 6 percent of college 
senIOr are graduates in 
engineering every year . 
Meanwhile univers ities in 
other industrial nations issue 
engineering degrees to 20 to 40 
percent of their graduates, 

Unless this trend is 
reversed,the US will be the 
technological wasteland of the 
industrial world by the year 
2000. 

That 's why it makes little 
sense for the administration 
and Congress to all but 
eliminate National Science 
Foundation programs which 
provide science and math 
teacher with up·to·date 
information and encourage 
young people to pursue careers 
in technology. 

As with 0 many other cuts, 

In the ad which 
appeared in our 
October 1, 1981 
issue advertising the 
International Club's 
Colombian Fiesta, 
there was a typo-
graphical error in 
the word "Colom-
bian", This was the 
error of The Guard-
ian, and we apolo-
gize to the Inter-
national Club, 

the admini tration justified 
redu ctio n s in scie ntif ic 
s upport in the name of curing 
the economy for future 
generations. 

" l! is no longer within our 
economic capability, nor 

perhap~ even desirable" said 
Whi le House Science Adviser 
George Keyworth last 
summer, " to aspire to primacy 
across the spectrum of 
scientific disci plines," 

Keyworth is on the right 
track. American mus t realize 
that we can't top world 
competition in every field 
anymore. A quick glance 
around your house and garage 
proves, for example, that 
Japan's broad commitment to 
universal math and science 
instruction has worked for 
that ~ation and is keeping ours 
runnmg too. 

Yet the administration is 
wrong to ignore that our 
engineering brain·drain could 
lead to total surrender to 
technological wizards abroad. 

It makes no sense to pull the 
plug on programs that keep 
science and math teachers up-
to·date when the United States 
needs desperatel y to plan 
ahead and maintain it s 
dwindling advantage in the 
world marketplace. Even 
Keyworth has admitted that 
science and math instruction 
" from very low level to the 
very top graduate level is 
probably not optimum for 
meeting the need s of the 
nation today ." 

Moreover, it's an insane 
propo s ition to ask the 
Ameri can people to move 
confidently forward with the 
immediate and presumably 
more "desirable" financing of 
highly·techn ical weapons and 
missi le systems when our 
goods and ervices have 
always blessed us with our 
finest sen e of "security." 

As Sen. Paul T songa (D· 

Mass.) notes in his new book, 
The Road From Here, it's 
unwise to throw all of the 
government's research and 
development money into 
military projects. 

"Let America achieve 
nuclear sup riority over the 
Russians and thejapanese WIll 
achie~e . microchip'processing 
supertonty over the Ameri · 
cans," he writes. "The Swiss 
will have an advantage in 
digital watches".the Germans 
will produce better naviga' 
tional equipment than 
Americans. And the British 
French, Taiwanese, Korean~ 
and Brazilians all w ill gain in 

production and prosperity at 
our expense. American will 
become a nation of unem· 
ployed workers and with 
foreign made products at 
home and American·made 
mis~ilcs at the ready'" 

This is no time to '>crap our 
science trainlllg program". 

Tn a world t hat wIll be 
increasingly dependent on 
unde.rstanding energy 
equat Ions and computer 
technology, we can't afford to 
~ome someone else's guinea 
pIgs. ~harpening our ability to 
appraIse n~w technological 
claIms and Information is the 
best testament we can leave to 

a coming generation . And 
keeping today's teachers up·to-
dale is a critical element in thi!> 
process. 

Because the Reagan 
administratIOn's cuts in 
:'(lence and technology won't 
be fully felt until the next 
century, It' hard forsclentl!>ts 
or corporate presidents to 
argue forcefully now for their 
retention. Thee cuts can't be 
called "cruel" or "uncompas· 
sionate" the way, perhap, 
cut to penSIoners or welfare 
mothers are correctly labeled. 

But they'll cause as much 
damage - if not more - in the 
long run.

Coffee, tea or poetry 
l'he track record last year 

for the Che Cafe Poetry Serie 
was very impressive, The 
weekly series hosted poet and 
writers, both of local and 
national repute, and the size of 
the audiences averaged close 
to 30 people a reading. 

As of this Tuesday, 7:30 

p,m" the Che Series will begin 
running again_ The first 
readers will be two Romanian 
poets, Mihai Ursachi and 
Marin Sorescu_ Ursachi is a 
highly personal and philoso-
phic writer while Sorescu is 
very unpretenious and popular 
for his much simpler approach 
to poetry_

God bless her. 

What would you do without her love? Her encouragement? 
Or her black walnut fudge?

without a tall, cold glass of milk? 

Milk makes those IIdelicious deliveries" 
taste even better. So when you open your goodies ... open the milk. 

And make sure your roommates don't eat your mail.
