II Choosing a new provost for Third II 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

laff Writer 
An intere ting paradox 

appear to be at work at 
UCSD. 

One committee, formed la t 
pring by Chancellor Richard 

Atkinson, i scrutinizing the 
four college system here, and 
may, some fear, recommend it 
be dismantled . 

At the arne time, another 
committee ha nearly 
completed it. earch for a new 
provo t for Third College, 
perhap the mo t distinctive 
college on campus. 

As the College Review 
Committee formally asses es 
UCSD's four-small-schools-
with in - a - big - universi ty 
system for the fi rst time ever , 
members of the college which 
some say would lose most by 
that system's abolishment 
await t he appoin tment of a 
replacement for Dr. Joseph 
Wat on, who left h is post as 
Third's provo t to become Vice 
Chancellor of Undergraduate 
Affair last July. 

Looming over thi ituation 
are pending tate budget cuts, 
which could total a much a 
five percent and which orne 
college loyalist u pect might 
prompt a move to a uni-college 
sy tern. 

"When the cuts are felt, and 
it comes down to a que tion of 
eliminating programs or the 
co tly and bureaucratic college 
y tern, it will all depend on 

where priori tie lie," say A 
commi sioner of tudent 
Welfare Reggie Williams. 

A Pre identJule Bagneri , 
however, ha aid he feels the 
mere creation of the College 
Review Committee marked 
the fir s t s tep toward 
elimination of the college 
sys tem , an accusation th 

committee's chairman, 
heldon Schultz, has trongly 

denied . 
In the hadow of thi. is 'ue 

tand four ca ndidates for the 
top admini trative post at 
Third: Faustina olis, acting 
Third provo s t : Charle 
Thomas; Edward Reynold 
and Ramon Ruiz. 

Thi week, they completed 
the final pha 'e of their 
candidacy for the provost 
po ition. appearing at open 
forum with members of the 
univer ity community. 

The following are summar-
ie of the views of two of the 
candidate - Faustina Solis 
and Charles Thomas - as 
expressed during those 
discussions. 

In Monday's issue of the 
Guardian, the remarks of 
Edward Reynolds and Ramon 
Ruiz will be presented. 

Faus tina Solis 
Named acting provost over 

the summer. Solis. who most 
recently erved as an associate 
profe or of community 
medicine at the Medical 
School. was not originally a 
candidate for the permanent 
post. An informal ground rule 
tipulated that the interim 

provo st could not be 
considered for the job. 

But "encouragement and 
pre, sures" from the Third 
College community prompted 
the earch committee to 
"rethink the rule," olis said . 

When the committee 
decided that being an acting 
provost was neither an 
advantage nor a disadvantage 
for a candidate, s he decided to 
contend for the pot. 

Soli ha spent the ' ix 
months he ha, been acting 
provost familiarizing herself 

with the "tructure of the 
college. " 

he ee one major problem 
facing Third to be recruitment 
and retention of tudents-
especially those discou raged 
by finan cial difficulties - and 
would like to see an increased 
committment tu affirmative 

Faus tina Solis 

action by the university a a 
whole. 

Lo of federal monetary 
support for the college due to 
budget cut i another i sue 

oli would immediately 
addre as provo l. she aid. 
adding that "we must 
augment existing resource. 
and find new ones to meet the 
needs of tudent ." 

She is firmly 'committed to 
the college y tern and believes 
it "effectively bring tudents 
and faculty into an arena of 
common intere t "within the 
university. 

While Soli expre se, a firm 
commiltment to the goal and 
principle ' upon which third 
college was built . she believe 
it has. trayed from its mis ion 
due to a loss of "the binding 

e prit de corps" which 
infected st udent s active in the 
college 's e tablishment. 

he recognize. a need "to 
recapture some of the spirit 
that pre\·ailed In the sixties," 
but ays she can't vet detect 
\\hich c:l!rectlOn the '\'ommun-
ity as a whole really want <; the 
colleg to go." 

he see the provo"t' 
re ponsibihtles as primarily 
" implementing policy." and 
providing "direction and 
u pervi ion for the college. " 

Charles Thomas 
Director of the Urban and 

Rural tudie Program, 
Thoma believe, above all , 
that Third College mu t 
"develop programs -
academic and extracurricular 
- which erve pecifically to 
implement the mission of the 
college. " 

As provo t, he would like to 
lead the colleg in" etting a 
tone" and creationg an 
atmo ph ere more repre enta· 
tie of what Third College i 
uppo edly all about. 

"We've mi , ed 0 many 
gloriou opportunitie ," say 
Thoma ,adding that there "i 
nothing (on the Third campus) 
to speak of its mi ion. The 
land cape doe n't speak of our 
multicultural population and 
there i no attempt to reinforce 
what' going on in the 
clas room through the 
environment. 

He attribute the route 

He has a strong allegiance to 
the college ytem and fear it 
\ .. ill be "pruned the mmute we 
get a di\iSlOn of engineering," 
a move which he sa\' "rivals

Hi,· fir. t pnority if named

'·self·study" of Third College. 
in which . tudent, .;taft.

"the poor reputation of Third 
College" and "the ho. tllitv

and feel the chancellor . hould

Dreams should 
live forever 

Tomorrow, January 15th, will be the Fifty-Second 
Anniversary of the birth of Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Martin Luther King, however, lived to celebrate only 
thirty-nine of his birthdays. He was the victim of an 
assassin's bullet , a tragedy that has become all too 
common in recent times, 

King's legacy is so revered and so well-known by 
Americans that it becomes difficult to pay him proper 
tribute. A man who believed that the American ideals 
of peace, freedom, and democracy applied to Blacks 
exactly the same as to Whites, and who fought for 
that cause with his life_ 

King's immortal words have become a hallmark of 
defenders of freedom all over America. "I have a 
dream, .. ," is a phrase that a ll Americans can take to 
heart. King lives on in the reforms he brough to the 
South and the inspiration he brought to the whole 
country. 

Tomorrow is a state office and pu blic school holiday 
in California. But this courageous step by the state 
legislature is not enough. In the past and present 
sessions of Congress , bills hvae been introduced to 
make January 15th a national holiday, in honor of 
Martin Luther King. Such a bill must be passed with 
the utmost speed. This is certainly the least we can do 
to preserve the memory of a man so intimately 
connected with a fundamental change in the fairness 
of the treatment of Blacks in this country. 

On Martin Luther King's birthday, we ask that you 
might do two things: first, take a moment to 
remember King and all that he stood for. And then , 
take ten more minutes and write a letter to your local 
Congressman or Senator urging him to work for the 
passage of the King holiday bill. 

If you have an opinion on something, write it 
down and send it to us. We only require that 
letter to the editor ubmissions be typed triple 
spaced on a 72-space line and that they bear a 
valid student signature.

Pacific News Service 

Community prevents arson 
By ELIZABETH LAFFERTY 

Pacilic News Service 
Five years ago, the Boston 

Fenway district was an urban 
inferno. More than a third of 
the 74 buildings that lined two 
treet s were se riously 

damaged or destroyed by fire 
in just one three-year period. 
Fenway had turned "hot," fire 
officials and some property 
owners said. because of 
random torchings by local 
vandals or irresponsible 
tenants who smoked in bed. 

But res ident s of this 
predominantly low·income 
com munity on Boston's north 
side simply were not buying 
the idea that they were 
burning down their own 
neigh borhood. r n 1976, as 
Fenway continued to burn, 
they established the Sympho· 
ny Tenant s Organizing 
Project (STOP ), which 
launched an unprecedented 
gras -root inve tigation into 
the fire wave. 

Today Fenway isn 't bu rning 
anymore. and what its 
residents learned in putt ing 
out the fire may help to put a 
major illegal enterpri e -
arson - out of bu iness all 
over the country. 

Using the public record , 
STOP began by research ing 
the his torie of buildings that 
had burned, and turned up a 
clear pattern: none was owner-
occupied; all were run-down 
and had numerou code 
violations; man y had changed 
ownership frequently in the 
few years prior to the fires; and 
many owners were in arrears 
on mortgage payments and 
property taxes. 

To te t the pattern , the 
group then measured the 
condition of ex isting buildings 
agai nst those which had 
burned , and publi ca ll y 
predicted which structures 
would burn next. After several 

s uch predictions proved 
accurate, a massive investiga· 
tion by the Massachusett 
attorney general' office, 
prompted by STOP's research, 
led to the arrests of 33 people. 
Among them were the former 
head of the Boston arson 
squad, retired police and fire 
officials, landlord • in urance 
adjusters and attorneys . 
Eventually , 31 were convicted, 
in what state Attorney 
General Francis Bellotti called 
"a huge cons piracy to burn 
Suffolk County for profit." 

Since the ]977 indictments, 
there has been only one major 
fire in Fenway, and arson fires 
in the Boston area have been 
reduced by 50 percent. 
Elsewhere, however, arson -
which kills approximately 
1,000 people per year -
continues to flourish . Experts 
belive that up to half of the 
600,000 arson fires reported in 
the United States in 1979 were 
et for profit. 
"Everybody blames arson 

fire on kids out for a kick," said 
Ernie Garneau of Urban 
Education Systems, a Boston-
ba ed arson research center. 
"That's absurd. Are these kid 
checking the public record to 
find out which areas are 
earmarked for redevelopment , 
or which landlords are in tax 
arrears, before they decide 
where to set fires? Arson·for-
profit is a big business and is 

' far more common than most 
people want to believe." 

STOP's success at ending 
its neighborhood's arson wave 
ha s in s pired some 30 
community organizations 
nationwide to form the 
National Ar on Prevention 
and Action Coalition (NA-
PAC). Because most municipal 
fire departments concentrate 
their money and time on fire 
suppression. neighborhood 
groups from New York to San 

Francisco are instead working 
toward preventing fires by 
organizing grass· roots arson 
early warning systems, based 
on the strategies developed by 
STOP. 

"Arson-for -profit is 
predictable because it has a 
pattern," explained Garneau, 
whose Urba n Education 
System sponsors NAPAC . 
"The duty of the community is 
not to become involved in 
criminal investigation. The 
idea of a community·based 
arson early warning system is 
to s top fires, not to put people 
in jail." 

Garneau and representa· 
tives from NAPAC conduct 
training seminars in 10 cit ies a 
year to help communities start 
such early warning sy tems, 
which identify arson-prone 
buildings and then work to 
deter the possibility of fire. 

"Take, for example," he 
s aid,"a building worth 
$200,000 wh ich is insured for 
$500,000 - a likely target for 
insurance fraud. A building 
profile would reveal that it 's 
rundown, has a high vacancy 
rate and turnover of building 
managers, and is not owner· 
occupied. The owner might be 
in tax arrears. The building 
might have a lot of small fires 
in a short period of time. These 
are what we call early warning 
fires , set to scare tenants into 
moving out to clear the way for 
the big fire. " 

The building typically 
would be sold several times in 
a few years, though little 
money would change hands, 
and the paper value of the 
property would be inflated 
wit h each transaction , 
explained Garneau. Thu, 
after a major fire the owner 
collects insurance on the 
inflated value of the property, 
and is exempt from paying

Video-games are 
sweeping the US 

America i unwittingl y 
urrendering to "Mr. Blip and 

Mr. Bong." 
These two character , who 

stand for the Great American 
Video Game, have been 

movin~ their batrle for the 
nation lei ure-time attention 
from the sidewalk arcades to 
humble American homes. 
Their victory eems ass ured. 

This holiday buyi ng eason 
was full of good cheer for 
retailers. But video games are 
finding a niche in thousands of 
household gift budgets. And 
yet the delirium over 
computerized games didn 't 
end Dec. 25: industry analysts 
estimate that the number of 
video-gaming households will 
jump from 2 million to 5 
million during 1982. 

Some might say that the 
video game, like air hockey 
tables and suitcase-sized tape 
players, will fall out of fashion , 
lea vi ng Am erica n s to 
popularize other pastimes. 

Yet the video game is not 
just any amusement. With a 
television in almost every US 
home, it stands to become an 
outright alternative to 
net work program m i ng . 
Moreover, as long a computer 
programmers devi e new 
way to puzzle players, their 
games will probably never 
prove boring. 

So far, the "videozation" of 

t he hou sehold has been 
lauded. For one, it's helped 
parents s teer their children 
away from less seemy arcades 
to the more·controlled living· 
room atmosphere. It 's also 
help ed make compu ter 
technology somewhat exciting 
and useful to the layman. 

Video ga me·makers are 
quick to applaud the active 
nature of their products. 
pointing to the number of 
potential player and ever-
increasing list of available 
game cartridges. 

And then there are the 
clinical benefits. William J. 
Lynch, who has used video 
games to treat patients at a 
Veterans Administratio n 
hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., 
told us how games uch as 
"Pong," one of the originals, 
have helped improve patients' 
peripheral vision and hand -
eye coordination. 

Lynch also hasten to 
reaffirm what other psycholo-
gists have suggested: that 
speed and finesse at electronic 
baseball , "Asteroids," and 
"Pac·Man" can enhance the 
elf·esteem of player who are 

otherwise athletic or social 
misfits. 

Indeed , quite a few of our 
contemporaries - many of 
them erious professionals 
and business people - have 
succumbed to the powers of

Blip and Bong. While they 
haven't lost their job a a 
result, they've let the video 
game become amoung their 
be t and most demanding 
friends. Video games can be as 
habit-forming as shooting 
craps but still lack the 
negative connotations of 
gambling. 

Unfortunately, the video 
game may bring out the wor t 
of our generation 's se lf-
ab orbing tendencies. For the 
many among us who, after a 
hard day' work, eek ever· 
increasing level of timula· 
tion and self·aggrandizement , 
it ha s nearl y nar co t ic 
qualitie , for which there are 
no known controls other than 
pulling the plug. 

Where social interplay i 
concerned , the video game' I 
benefits may be double-edged . 
On e's fascination with 
conquering the machine might 
lower one' tolerance for 
personal contact and serve a a 
sub titute for the frivolity that 
makes us human - and them 
machines. An yone who's 
played Atar i' "Asteroids" 
understands that nothing les 
than a no-holds-barred 
approach to the game is 
required. 

Similar "toy .. cau, e imilar 
inversion s. The Sony 
"Walkman," one of the many 
hi-fi , pocket-sized tape players, 
does a equally good job of 
blotting out earthly concern . 
Collec tivel y, such cheap 

escapes could eventually lead 
to detached behavior in 
ourselves and our chi ldren. 

We won't quabble with 
purchaser who en e the 
dangers a well a the benefits 
of thi year's most wanted gift. 
If played with c linical 
temperance, the new games 
could help instill elf-doubter 
with feelings of success, bring 
our hou eholds close together 
and build computer literacy. 

But ince mo t home aren 't 
run like climes. even the mo t 
sophisticated among us hould 
under tand the powers of Mr. 
Blip and Mr. Bong before the e 
two game ten, tart playing

Tomorrow morning, the 

Studen t Center Board will 
meet to discuss the future of 
the Stu d ent Center's 
management. While the board 
has yet to make any decision s , 
several people involved have 
strong suggestions. 

Reggie Williams, the board 's 
A.S. representative, and the 
Com m issioner of tudent 
Welfare, emphasized that " the 
board mu t be made more 
accountable and respon, ive to 
the students. tuden!. don 'I 
have enough inpu t into

is to be spent. " 

Williams cited the recent 
raise in Student Center fee ' as 
an example. Last year. PC 0 
students voted against a 
referendum question which 
would raise the Student 

Center fees, but fees were 
rai sed anyway, Willi ams 
complained . 

A . S . Pr es id e nt Jule s 
Bagneri echoed this and other 
complaint . He attnbuted the

their original purpose, whtch

al 0 voted to require that 
potential confhcts of intere t 
surrounding a re earch project 
be reviewed by an independent 
university panel which would 
ultimately decide the project' , 
future. 

"This commis ion ha to

"If someone want to u e

research that will benefit a 
private company, I wa nt to 
know about it ," Meverhoff 
said . . 

Com mi s ioners spent their 
first workday morning of the

testimony on the matter from 
CRLA and university officials , 
as well as receiving the

FPPC s taff representative 

Barbara Milm an reported that 
eViden c e from previous 
testimony suggests that UC 
facultv membe r s make 
government deC! Ion that 
affect them elve ' financially 
when deciding what' to 
research , and the commission 
is therefore legally reqUIred to 
enforce against the university 
a conflIct of inlerest code. 

Milman told commis ioner 
that the extent of academic 
infusion into private industry 
is greater than it was four 
year ago. when the 
commis ion authorized the 
faculty exemptions, with the 
emergence of high· tech field 
such as genetic engin~ring. 

''The potential for con fhct of

Gov. Brown issues 
state evaluation 

By HENRY SCHULMAN 
Sacramento Correspondent 

SACRAMENTO - The key 
to California 's economic 
health lies in high technology 
fields and schools should 
appropriately tres the three 
"C .' - computing, calcula· 
ting and communication:, 
through technology -
Governor Jerry Brown told a 
joint session of the legislat ure 
last week. 

Brown focu ed mOht of hi:' 
20-minute annual State of the 
State address on CalifornIa 's 
role in the high·tech education 
and devlopment. sayi ng the 
state is not as strong a leader it 
once was. 

Consequently. the governor 
ca lled on schools to toughen 

graduation requirements for 
high chool and university 
tudents . 
"Electronics, computers, 

sa tellites. bIOtechnology, 
robotics. these are no longer 
dreams." Brown said. "They 
are the driving imperative that 
IS restructuring the world 
economv. These new techno-
logies . are fundamentally 
changing our communica-
tions, agriculture, environ-
ment , . chooltng, financial 
In titutions, fami ly life and 
our national secu rity. 

Signs of 'Josh' are everywhere 

"California is now the 
leader in these technologies, 
but we will not remain so 
unle s we mobilize the 
political will and responsibi· 
lity to act." 

Brown told legislators that 5 
million Soviet students study 
calculus in high school or their 
first yea r of college, compared 
with only 500,000 in the 
United States. The Soviets 
teach algebra, geometry and 
trigonometry in grades 6-10 
and require a total of over 10 
years of physics. chemistry 
and biology for all high school 
graduates , he said. 

continued from page 5 
de cribe the events concer-
ning the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ and its significance in 
both Christian and secu lar 
history. Getting the most out 
of a relationship, physically , 
psychologically, and spiritu-
ally, is the basis behind 
Thursday 's message, "Max-
imum Sex." Both lectures will 
be held with free admission in 
the Revelle Cafeteria at 8:30 
p.m. In addition to his evening 
appearances , Josh ha s 
tentatively scheduled an open 
speech on Revelle Plaza at 

12:15 p.m. , Wedne day, and a 
luncheon / conference with 
professors and members of the 
pre s in the Revelle Informal 
Lounge at 12 noon, Thursday. 

Students, however , cou ldn 't 
have guessed as much from 
the publicity, unless they were 
already familiar with Josh or 
Campus Crusade. 

"Some people think he's a 
cult. some people don't know 
what to think," said Curtis 
Ohl , a member of Campus 
Crusade and publicity director 
for Josh. "A lot of our stuff has 
been tone(l down . But , 

generally , the re pon e ha 
been good. in a mood of 
curiosity." 

Using Josh 's name as a 
teaser for the pas t week and a 
half wasn't solely devised by 
the UCSD chapter of Campus 
Crusade. Representatives 
from the In ternational 
Headquarters in Arrowhead 
Springs, San Bernadino, came 
to the uni versity and 
presented to the group, in 
Ohl's words, "a general 
outline." The rest, he added, 
"was up to our discretion and 
how much money we wanted

So far, the publicity director 

and hi s taff have ucces full y

"Saturation is one of the 
most effective ways to

based training and re o 
training," the governor said, 

Although Brown presented 
no pecific legislation for his 
proposals, he outlined 
guidelines he wanted pur ued, 
including: 

- en urance that every 
California high school student 
learns at least three year of 
math and two years of science, 
The present requirement are 
one year of each . 

"For those going to college, 
the universitie should et 
higher goal unt il we mea ure 
up to our potential and to the 
competition," he continued. 

- an increa e in funding for 
the university y terns for 
engineering, computer cience 
and related cience instruc· 
tion Brown aid he will a k 
legi lator to et a - ide sta te 
money which would be 
matched by pm'ate indu try to 
accomplish thi goal. 

- additional funding for 
vocational education through 
community colleges and adult 
chool programs to "prepare 

men and women for the new 

information·ba ed jobs of the 
'80s. " 

In Brown ' proposed 1982· 
83 budget to be announced 
tomorrow, he will ask for a 2.5 
percent cut for the University 
of California, lower than the 
cut propo ed for other tate 
agencies. 

Part of the university" 
budget will include additional 
funds for high· tech education 
and research, but the UC's 
chief Sacramento Lobbyist, 
Dr. Lowell Paige, warned 
y ste rday that Brown's 
propo al will not greatly 
alleviate the univer ity's 
econom ic woes. 

Paige said the proposed 
advantage the univer ity has 
in this year' budget i ' held 
together by "mirror~ and 
chewing gum," which still 
must tand the te t of a heated 
ix·month legis lative battle. 

Most of the money Brown 
alluded to in hi s tate of the 

tate address yesterday would 
be s pent in grades K· 12 and in 
community colleges. he ·aid . 

But he added that "if what 
has been proposed remains 

intact the university has done 
all right in view of the press ing 
economic concerns of the 
tate." 
The remainder of Brown's 

address was spent comple· 
menting the "t ruly impres· 
sive" artistry and craft in the 
newly·re tared west wing of 
the state capitol building. He 
also told the story of his ~reat· 
grandfathers' "spirit' in 
making the dangerous cross· 
country trek to California in 
1852. 

On the capitol. he said that 
"in all candor, J must admit I 
was skeptical of this project. In 
those days , 1 was thinking of 
less and cou ldn 't imagine the 
magnificence of this building 
and the inspiration it would 
give to school children to carry 
our tradition into the 21st 
centu ry ." 

About his great·grandfather 
and his fellow travelers' 
"Imagine the pirit that drove 
those men and women ... . these 
were men and women who 
matched our mountain , and 
in not too many years , built 
these walls." 

This was only Brown's third 
tate of the State address in 

the ornate Assembly cham· 
bers. which were closed from 
1975 until las t week for 
reconstruct ion . 

.At the governor's s ide was 
his father, former Governor 
Pat Brown, and in the 
audience was Sister Alice 
Joseph , hi s eighth·grade 
teacher. 

Response to the governor's 
. address from his legis lative 
allies and foes was quick and

A-bomb research declassified, released 

Documents shed light on process of cracking the atom 
This is the second and final 

part of a series that began inlasl 
Thursday's Guardian. 

The encouraging new 
precipitated an even more 
strenuous program of design 
and procurement at Los 
Alamos. Real bomb compon· 
ents were sought , instead of 
ballistic model unit . 

Los Alamos was concentra· 
ting on three specific bomb 
models: the Little Boy model of 
the uranium·235 gun as em· 
bly; the so·ca ll ed 1222 
implosion a embly Fat Man 
(which required the insertion 
of more that 1500 bolts!); and 
the finally adopted 1561 Fat 
Man implosion assembly , 
which was a redesign of 1222. 
The final Fat Man had 
improved flight characteris· 
tics because of its ellipsoidal 
shaped outer armor. It 
consisted of an inner 
spherical shell made up of two 
polar caps, and a segmented 
control zone which cou ld be 
bolted together and surround· 
ed by an armor ellipsoid , to 
which a stabilizing tail, wi.th 
necessary drag plates, cou ld be 
attached. The auxiliary fusing 
and electrical detonating 
equipment were mounted in 
the space between the inner 
sphere and outer ellipsoid. 

In August , 1943, Los Alamos 
"froze" design of the outer 
shapes of the three models, so 
that modification of 15 aircraft 
could begin. Work began on 
the B·29 in September and the 
first plane was available in 
October. The special modifica-
tions for carrying and 
releasing the bomb incorpor· 
ated the British relea e 
mechanism for a 12,000· 
pound weapon, and the 
mechanism required only a 
s ingle lug on the bomb itself . 

Wendover Air Force Base 
\Va chosen as a training 
center for an Atomic Bomb 
Group , who se parent 
organization was the Second 
Air Force. Colonel Paul 
Tibbetts was chosen com· 
mander of the combat 509 
Composite Group. 

The first te ·ts began at 
Wendover in October. 1944, 
and continued until August, 
1945, when the first atomic 
born b was dropped on 
lIiroshima. Unit s approaching 
closer and closer to the final 
weapons were tes ted for 
ballistic, electrical fu~ing . 

electric .. , "etonator, aircraft 
release mechanism, vibra· 
tions, and temperature 
information. Between Febru-
ary 20,1945, and August, 1945, 
a number of test drops were 
made. 

Ramsey's delivery program 
was a continuing series of 
development , de ' ign , produc· 
tion, and tests of the \\'eapon . 
The 1222 Fat Man , with its 
hundred of bolts, was 
dropped in fa vor of Fat Man 
1561. Problems withs the first 
batch of modified B-29 
bomber led to procur ment of 
15 other planes. These B·29s 
had fuel-injection engines; 
electric·pitch·controlled 
propellers, and rugged 
provisions for carrymg the 
bombs. All armamment was 
removed except for tail·t urret 
guns . 

Project A at Los Al amo'i now 
occu pied itself wit h comple' 
tion of the des ign . procure· 
ment . a nd preliminary 
as. embly of \\eapons that 
would be complete in every 
way for u. e with uranium and 
plutomium; with continuation 
of the Wendover Air Force 
Base test program, to confirm 
- without using active 
materials - the adequacy of 
the weapons to be used against 
the enemy; and preparation for 
overseas operations against 
Japan . 

"Such matters as the exact 
design of the tamper spheres 
for the bombs, the incorpora' 
tion of features to make a trap· 
door assembly possible, the 
inclusion of a hypodermic tube 
between the high·explosive 
(HE) blocks for monitoring 
purposes. and the s trengthe· 
ning of the Little Boy tail. 
characterize thi s period." 
according to Ramsey. "The 
failure of a contractor to meet 
It s delivery schedule on time 
for X·units (firing dc\ ices for 
electrical deton ators) added 
markedl v to the diffi cl!ltle~ of

run twice - once \\ith a ll

and once. at a criticall) late

Despite these difficulties . a 

total of 155 test unit were 
dropped at Wendover or the 
Salton Sea in California 
between October and the 
middle of August in . 1945. 
I nformat ion gained from these 
tests was incorporated into the 
final de ' ign of the bomb . 

Preliminary constructIOn 
began at Tinian I. land in the 
Pacific in April, 1945, Wit h 
technical activities following 
in July. A Little Boy unit was 
assem bled and Un i t L·1 was 
tested - a test that used a 
radar fuse to detonate the 
dummy weapons in mid·air. A 
second Little Boy dummy was 
tested , then a third. A fourth 
mock weapon was reserved for 
testing emergency reloadi ng of 
the bomb into another aircraft 
on IwoJima. 

The first Fat :\I an test at the 
island base. {nit F·13, was 
made on August \. The model 
u sed cast·p laster block::;, 
electronic fusing, and eight 
elect ric detonators . A second 
inert Fat Man wa' loaded into 
a B·29 Augu st 3, but Tinian 
had n ot received vital 
information on the result of 
earlier Fat Man tests of the 
adequacy of the venting in a 
sealed unit. The Augu t 3 te t 
was po tponed until Augu t 5, 
when modification to 
barometric witche had been 
made. The modification 
worked well . and wa s 
adequate for the internal 
pressure to close a barometric 
switch set for 17,000 feet 
pressure altitude, 17 second 
before impact. A final "dry· 
run" with a dummy Fat Man 
was made on August 8, with 
satisfactory results. 

On Julv 26, 1945. the {'·23S 
project ile' for Little Boy was 
deli vered to TmIan by the 

cru ise r Indianapoli s. The 
uranium target insert arrived 
in three separate parts in three 
otherwise empty Air Trans· 
port Command C-545. on the 
evening of July 28 . 

Ramsey's history concludes 
quite s uccinctly , with a log 
kept by his boss. Captain 
Parsons , when LIttle Bo\', the

Boston creates a program to control arson 
continued from page 4 
noticeable' decline in the 
building's maintenance, since 
the real priority i not 
managing property, but 
burning, converting and 
selling the units a quickly as 
possible. 

"Converters hate pu bli-
city,' said Garneau. "They 
often consider themselves 
respectable developers, and 
rely on investors who don't 
want to be associated with 
slum lords, so organized 
tenants who publicize the 
deteriorating cond ition of their 
building can make the 
converter back off." 

"When you've done your 
research and have the facts to 
validate suspicions ," advised 

t 

FeliceJergen ,an organizer for 
the People' Firehou e in 
Brooklyn, "the worst thing 
you can do i accuse the owner 
of being an arsonist. If you so, 
you've not only lost your 
credibility, but you've lost 
your fight against arson. 
Simply call the owner ' fire-
prone.' 

" Set up 24-hour security 
programs, with tenants and 
community groups taking 
shifts to watch that no one is 
in the building who doesn't 
belong there. Do what you can 
to make that building visible, 
and to let the owner and the 
public know that the local 
arson prevention organization 
i watching very closely, and 
will continue to do so until the 

conditions in the building are 
such that it no longer is fire· 
prone. " 

In San Franci co, where fire 
officials ay they cannot 
remember an arrest in recent 
years for economically 
motivated arson, a community 
group in the fire-prone Mission 
di strict now is developing an 
arson prevention program. 
One of its first targets is the 
Carmelita Apartments, a 42· 
unit masonry structure which 
has had a series of small fires 
over the last year. The 
organizat ion's research 
di closed that the holder of the 
building's lease had a history 
of leasing bui ldings which had 
frequent fires. 

Down the street from the 

Carmelita i a large cav ity, a 
half block in size and 25 feet 
deep, that serves as a painful 
reminder of arson's conse-
quence for Miss ion residents_ 
The Gartland Apartments 
once stood there until a 
December night in 1976 when 
an arsonist poured gasoline 
down the staircase. Twelve 
people perished in the fire. The 
Gartland, too, had numerous 
code violations and had 
experienced five small bla2es 
in a short period prior to the 

tra~edy. 
• The Carmel ita ha s 

alarming similarities to the 
Gartland right before it 
burned," said Ruth Lopez of 
the North Mission Associa· 
tion, which picketed the 

Gartland two week before t he 
[atal fire. " Bu t the difference 
between the two is the 
differen ce in commu'1ity 
involvement. " Since t h e l2 st 
blaze at the Carmel ita, the 
North Miss ion Associat ion has 
met with tenants of that 
building who subseq uently 
launched a rent strike . 
Substandard conditions were 
publiciezed, as was the name 
of the absentee owner. 

As a result, life in the 
Carmelita is beginning to 
change. The owner ha taken 
an active role in meeting with 
the ten~nt . Repairs are 
beginning to be made, and the 
lease of the man who had a 
history of fires in his buildings 
has been revoked.

'Reds' is a true film masterpiece 
Beatty does it all in drama on love, communism and values 

BY MIKE THOMAS 
I think that Diane Keaton 

must have somet hing of the 
muse about her. For it seems 
that she has inspired two of 
the men in her life, Woody 
Allen and Warren Beatty , to 
reach for something deep 
within themselves and create 
some of the boldest work in 
contemporarr American 
cinema. Allen s pre-Keaton 
comedies were clever but facile 
and cinematically inept. But 
with Love and Death , Annie 
Hall and Manhattan. he 
developed a mis-en·scene that 
blossomed alongside of hi 
growing narrative powers . 

And now, suddenly, Warren 
Beatty, whom, (correct me if , 
I'm wrong here) no one had 
predicted as the next Orson 
Welles, has made in Reds, one 
of the mo t heroic personal

Ii seems by somebody's 
declaration (certainly not 
mine) that Gone With the Wind 
a nd Citizen Kane are the two 
greate t Hollywood films but 
for my money. Reds su rpasses 
them both. Beatty's film is the 
great, pa sionate love story 
that I always had thoug ht that 
Vivien Le ig h a nd Clark

upremely cynical Eugene

Nichol on to layoff his 
eyebrow waving hi trionic 
and underplay hi every

and wearine . His confronta· 
tion with Keaton, when he 
dismis e her revolut ionary 
dogma as "just anot her form of 

Irish Catholicism" crackles 
with intelli~ence and tension. 

Equally effective are 
Maureen Stapleton's gruff 
anarchist Emma Goldman ,

Bols hevik bureaucrat (filled 
with grim irony in the light of 
recent ev~nts in his native 
Poland), George Plimpton's 
unctuous Horace Whigham

hows what popular mu ic can

omething that modern money

In these dark days presided

res ultant unemployed (obvi· 
ouly they 're not on the right

unbending principles, ruthles 
when necessary, the perfect

The most interesting and 
disturbing aspect of Liddy 's 
story is how readily he was 
accepted , or at least tolerated, 
by tho e who employed him, 
es pecially in the upper 
eche lons of the Nixon 
Administration . 

Will, C. Cordon Liddy 
doesn't linger long on the 
Watergate mess, but devotes a

to Liddy's jail term . Hi fellow

of life. Outstanding blues-guitari t, B.B. King will play here Monday_ 

So what more appropriate 
entertainment could there be 
than a television adaptation of 
Liddy's autobiographical book, 
Will? And what more

lead than that fellow embodier

to be a fa cinating two hours, 
almost in spite of itself. fn 
terms of quality, the film 
rarely rises above the 
mediocre, but Liddy' life 
history receives the treatment 
it deserves. 

The act ing in this film is not 
of the high est order. but it 
doesn't take much ski ll to 
regi s ter discomfort , the 
predominate emotion here. 
Robert Conrad portrays Liddy 
wit h a straightness of purpose. 
without the intensity which a 
better actor probably would 
have brought to the part. 
Conrad's playing i effective 
and appropriate. a it \'ery 
blandness s uggests that, while 
Liddy may be an extreme case, 
there are many others who are 
almo t as far gone. 

With a wh iskey·smooth 
voice and s harp punctuating 
guitar riffs. he si ngs of 

dt~pression, hatred, possession 
and betrayal - things 
common to us all. And while 
the pain is never far away , 
there i also the burning hope 
and joy of the moment that 
keep us all going. Just listen to 
the fabulous huffle boogie 
from the late 50's, "Crazy 
'Bout My Baby" and your 
houiders'll be hiftin' and 

your feet will keep fast time. 
B.B. King 's unique blues

Is a 'golden age' of 
sports enterging? 

Is Ih is Ihe begilln ing of a "golden age "lor sports at UCSD? Many 
Athletic Departmenl stalf members believe that UCSD is on the 
verge 01 a new era. Enlhusiasm and participation in Intramural 
sports has reached unheard of levels. Intercollegiate clubs. such as 
women 's volleyball and men's waterpolo are leading a pack of 
talented leams. Yet, female in tramural parlicipation is low, 
coaching salaries are scandalously small !l nd money is tight 
everywhere. 

In a three-pari series Guardian reporters Larry Goldnwn and 
Phil Lauder explore the past, present arId fulure of UCSD 
Intramural and In terco/legia te athletics. Areweenteringa "golden 
age" at UCSD? 

BY LARRY GOLDMAN 
la ft Wriler 

The participation in 1M 
spor ts has been steadily 
increasing over the yea rs . 

orne of this increa e can be 
attributed to the growth in 
popu lation of UC D but 1M 
directors Mike Hipp and cott 
Bernde agree that the mam 
reason for the increase I the 
renewed high intere t gwen to 
sports and fitness in the pa~t 
couple of years. 

Examples of some of the 
mcrcasc'i in I:'.1 sports "\Oce 
1974 han' been a doubling of 
tpam s In foot ball from 7:3 
teams to 149 m 19 1, an 
Increase from 134 clu bs to 2;)2 
in softball, and an Increa:-.e 
from 23 squads to 100 In 
·occer. 

Another result of thi added 
i n terest has been the 
implementation of new ports 
in t he program. Sport added 

i n ce 1976 have bee n 
Hawaiia n football, team 
ten ni ,team badmin ton, team 
bowling, and u ltimate fri bee. 
In fact, according to the 
statistic, in 1974 there were 
4450 ros te red p I ayers 
compared to 11,333 in 1981. an 
increase of 155%. 

The Recreation clubs on the

IRIS parl1C1pant: in 19 1 but 
m 19 1 partiCIpation dropped 
g.", from 19 0 and IS expeeted

with those of the past, one 
notices somethi n g very 
quickly. Today's teams are 
better. The athletes on the 
team are better, the 
competition IS at a hlghter 
level. and the teams a . a whole 
are having more success now 
than ever before. What is the 
reason for thiS progresslOn? 
The first and most obVIOUS 
place to look i. in t he area of 
lOaching. 

A ' a group. the coaches of 
today make up the mo t 
dedicated and most lICces ful 
coaching staff ever a embled 
at UC D. Athletic DIrector 
Judith Sweet explain s, " We've 
had talented a n d skilled 
coaches in t he past, bu t in the 
group we have now are 
individuals who have made a 

trong commitment to 
UCSD' ports program. The 
result is that for the fir t time 
in the eight year I've been 
here, we began the chool year 
with only one coaching 
po ition not filled, a very low 
turn·over rate." 

Bill Morgan. coach of the 
men's and women's swim 
teams . exemplifies thiS 
commitment "We In tht S\\ I 1

Teams head 
for B-ball 
showdown 

BY VALERI S. ANDER 
tall Writer 

Int ramural Basketball thi 
Sunday w ill see t he team 
"Freak Bro thers take on the 
brothers of "Tau Kappa 
Epsilon" fraternity in single A 
action. 

Freak Brother have played 
a a team for the pa t three 
years, whi le TKE formed thi 
quarter after the fraternity 
wa named a colony (UCSD's 
fir st nationa l ly ba se d 
fraternity ) in the fall. 

0, whi le "Freak Brothers" 
have played basketball in pa t 
season , and made it to the 
play·offs in both football and 
oftball, TKE comes into the 

game with little previous 
experience. 

Last week, Frea k Brot her~ 
lost to WA;vlP 17-45. "We 
weren't really organized," ~aid 
captain Dave Zack. " It was the 
first game, and the ot her team 
was very well prepared." Zack 
plans to have a few practice 
games each week in the fu ture, 
and hope the ex perience and 
abi lity of player' like David 
Cho, and Rick Minerman will 
help hi team . 

TKE, despite its s hort 
existence put one in the win 
column last weekend with a 
61·38 victory over " uper 
Chicken." Captain T odd 
Stayart cored the mo t points 
for the Greek: 15, while Brad 
Mindlin rebounded , and John 
McNamara came through 
with out s lrtnding defense. 

Game time for Freak 
Brothers v . TKE i. 12 noon in 
the main gym , east court -
this Sunday.

with six points. 

CSD suffered clearly from 
the loss of 6'4" sophomore 
Forward Michael Barney, who 
was declared academically 
i nelegible for the remainder of 
the 1982 season. Barney was 
averaging 15.0 points per 

~ howing thus far and was a big 
plu~ for the Triton s 
underneath.

Coaches key to intercollegiates 
l'I lIIt i nllc d f rom I>age 15 
such a dedicated attit ude made 
you an exception here; now, 
there are many coaches wi th 
this attitude, and it's a great 
s ituation to be in." 

Judy Malone , women's 
basketball coach, adds, " In the 
past , our attitude was geared 
toward haing fun, not to really 
being competitive. That 's all 
changed now." 

This new attitu de o f 
commitment and dedication 
can be t be de cribed as 
admirable when considering 
the alaries these coache get. 
A men's ba ketball coach 
John Block de cribe it, "Ours 
i really a job of sacrifice. We 
put in a trem endous amount of 
t ime, and we're all looking 
forward to the time when we 
get a decent salary to show for 
it." 

What they get now is a less· 

than ·decent sa la ry. " Our 
coache get about $1800 to 
$2000 a year," say Sweet, 
" and that' s our bigges t 
concern . Obviously , these 
coaches have to work other 
jobs to support themselves, 
un less they' re independently 
wealthy. That 's the reason for 
our high turn·over rate in the 
pa. t. Our funds for alaries 
come from s tudent registra· 
tion f es, and we have to fight 
for the little we gel. We do 
encourage our coaches to teach 
P.E. classe to supplement 
their income, and this 
summer, for the first time, 
we'll be spon oring summer 
camps, which will hopefully 
bring in more money for our 
program." 

Despite the reality of low 
wage today, most coaches are 
hopeful for improvements 
oon. Becau e of this hope and 

dedication , there is more 
continuity in UCSD coaching 
now than ever before. For 
example, women's tenni 
coach Liz Dudash is in her I 
third year here; swim coach 
Bill Morgan has coached the 
men's team for five years and 
the women' s team the last 
two; volley ball coach Doug 
Dannevik has coached four 
years with the men 's team and 
three with the women's team 
that, this year. won the 
National Champions hip. Also, 
Judy Malone has headed the 
women's basketball team for 
six years now, and Denny 
Harper, CCAA Water Polo 
Coach of the Year, is now in 
his second year. 

Continuity is now typical at 
UCSD. Second year coach 
Block explain the importance 
of this: "Our teams need to

best ideas yet devised to help you save 
money while you reduce traffic 
congestion, conserve energy,and 
improve the quality of air in San Diego. 
The Parking & Transit Systems Office, in 
conjunction with San Diego Commuter 
Computer, wi II send you a list of other 
students to contact in order to start 
your carpool. Just stop by our office at 
400 Warren Campus and fill out an 
application form. Shortly thereafter 
you will receive a list of other students 
who live in your neighborhood who 
would also like to share a ride to UCSD, 
Carpooling isn't just an energy- or cost-
efficient way to commute - ifs also an 
easy way to make new friendsf

have thi con i tency in 
coaching so that, when a coach 
recruits a freshman , the 
player can feel reasonably ure 
that his coach will be around 
when he graduate ." 
Furthermore , coaching 
changes bring along changes 
in philosophyy and tyle 
which force the athlete to 
adjust; uch problem 
di appear when there are no 
coaching changes. 

In short, the coache now at 
UCSD are more dedicated and 
s tay with their teams longer 
than coaches of the past. Thi 
is reflected in their increased 
success. Many teams now 
have winning records; this 
wasn 't true only a few years 
ago. Even the teams without 
winning records are progress-
ing. Malone's 2-10 women's 
team, for example, has played 
ix Div. I . chools so far this 

season, while in the pastlC's 
provided the heavy competi-
tion. Block's basketball team 
is al 0 s imilar to other teams 
who e won-lo t record don 't 
show the progre actually 
made. 

The coaching at UC D 
today has made intercollegiate 
ports teams more competi-

tive. Howard Hunt , Chairman 

of the PhYSical EducatIOn 
Department and with that 
department since it Inception 
in 1965, sums the situation up 
nicely: "Considering all 
intercollegiate team now at 
UCSD, right now, we are at 
the highe t level of competi-
tion in thi chool' hi torv."
