Aftinnative Action Debate Heats Up 
PROPOSITION 209: 
California Civil Rights

By Paul Dodge 
Staff Writer 

The California Civil Rights 
Initiative(CCRI), formally known 
a California Proposition 209, be-
came the topic of a heated debate 
Monday. At the Institute of the 
America's Auditorium, representa-
tives of both sides of the issue pre-
sented their cases to the public in a 

panel discu ·sion. 
The controversial proposal . to be 

put to the voters in November's gen-
eral election, would eliminate affir-
mative action and other state-run 
programs that give preferential treat-
mentto people on the basis of their 
race, gender, or ethnic background .

SIO Scientists to Resume ATOC Testing 
Despite Environmentalists' Concerns 
SOUND: Environmentalists 
worry that testing may have 
caused three whale deaths 
By EI.'ne Johnson 
Guardian Reporter 

Scientists at the Scripps Institution of Ocean-
ography announced Monday plans to continue the 
Aeoust ic Thermometry of Ocean CI i mate (A TOC) 
program. despite the concerns of some environ-
mentalists that A TOe has resulted in the deaths of 
three whales. 

In a move that will COincide with the one-year 
anniversary of the Pioneer Seamount source in-
stallation, scientists announced they are planning 
to install a low-frequency sound source off the 
coast of Kauai, Hawaii, later this month. The 
ATOC program is an experiment on global warm-
ing. run 'through UCSD's Scripps Institute of 

Oceanography (SIO). 
The plan to install the Hawaii source comes 

after a year of controversy over the Pioneer Sea-
mount installation and subsequent deaths of thrce 
whales found near the San Francisco coastline. 
Environmental groups have expressed concern 
that the program and the deaths of the whales may 
be related. 

ATOC scientists transmit low-frequency 
sound waves to 18 receivers em the Pacific Rim. 
The Hawaii transmi ion center will join the cur-
rently operational source in California. The 
soundwaves are transmitted at various strengths 
- ranging from 26 wailS to 260 watts - at four 
hour intervals for a duration of twenty minutes. 

The acoustic travel times from the sources to 
the receivers will be used to study the ocean's 
temperature variability and climate change. and 
also to asse s the effects of low-frequency sound

today from its home port for the 
fi rst ti me since arriving in San Di-

As part of an "Instructional Technology Initiative" aimed 
at improving the availability and quality of the university 'S 
instructional technology programs, the UC Office of the 
President (UCOP) has proposed raising students fees up to 
$200 a year. While improving the university 'S technological 
infrastructure is a worthwhile goal, thi s latest proposal is a 
recipe for disaster. 

The proposal is flawed in two major ways. First, the addi-
tional revenues that will be raised by the fee increa e were 
neither requested nor planned for by the computing-services 
departments at the various UC campuses. In fact, the pro-
posed fee increase came as a surprise to officials here at 
UCSD. Furthermore, UCOP has not specified how the funds 
will be spent - except to say they will be eannarked for 
"improved teaching and learning, student upport, library 
access and networks." 

'UCOP recently asked all UC campuses to submit a list 
enumerating their technological needs and priorities. 
Unfortunately, campus administrators were given precious 
little time to examine their particular needs and return a com-
pleted list. Instead, administrators probably rushed to finish 
their proposals in hopes of grabbing as big a piece of ~he 
funding pie as poss ible. This rush to tie down future fundtng 
combined with such a broadly defined initiative would 
encourage wasteful spending at a time when many students 
are already straining under the heavy fee burden. 

UCOP should make sure the benefits of any plan are 
greater than the costs. Unfortunately, thi s lates t proposal from 
UCOP fails to clearly address either how the UC would spend 
the 'money or whether such an expenditure is even necessary. 

Rai~ng student fees without a clear purpose is unfair to stu-
dents and an invitation for wasteful spending. 

FunIIng of \Vomen's caller 
"' .... Real Pricwitias 

The efforts of nearly 20 years of pushing UCSD's 
administration for official recognition and funding came 
to fruition for the new Women's Center this past Monday 
as its doors were officially opened for business . 

Unfo~lUnately, in the midst of all the jubilation over final-
ly getting state funding, everyone apparently overlooked 
the fact that UCSD really didn' t need the center in the first 
place. . 

Nowadays, with complaints constantly on the lips of 
UCSD students about rising fees, it doesn't seem right to 
be increasing student services at the university that are 
peripheral to education. In addition, most, if not all: of the 
services offered at the Women's Center overlap wtth ser-
vices already offered by other '~rganizations at the univer-
sity. 

If students ate really serious about keeping . fees low, 
and if the amount of money allocated to the UC system by 
the _state remains constant or rises by an amount equal to 
or less than the rate of inflation. they cannot expect 
increases in student services - especially those not 
directly related to academics. 

We at the Guardian feel t~at it is more important to 
maintain the affordability of educution at UCSD than to 
provide every special interest group with its own study 
center or support program. 

But hey, at least we're np longer the only UC campus 
without a funded Women's Center. If UCSD had parents, 
they would be sadly shaking their heads, ashamed that we 
had finally gone and jumped off a bridge just because all 
our friends did it first.

These were a

headlines 
Reuters ran on

Resident this week fol-
Gadfly lowing the 

fullest ex.tent possible. Now, four years later, President 
Clinton assure us that his track-record includes " 10.5 
million new jobs, ri sing incomes, falling crime rates 

and welfare roles [andl a strong 
America at peace." 

Economic uncertainty has been 
banished from our country! We are 
all earning more now than we were 
four years ago! Wouldn 't we be 
insane to avoid President Clinton's 
advice to "keep it going" by elect-
ing him? 

---..;...;-- first match-up 
between Bill Clinton and Bob 
Dole. They confirmed the conven-
tional wisdom leading up to last 
weekend's showdown in Hartford, 
Conn., that neither candidate 
would be able to inject any enthu-
siasm into this fall's all-but-decid-
ed campaign. 

1118 candidates 
muddled their way 

How the president could stand 
there and take credit for all the 
good news over the past four years 
is beyond me. Washington - let 
alone the White House - did not 
create 10.5 million jobs over the 
past four years. Private citizens 
did. And wages, by any reasonable 
measure , are not rising to the 
extent that President Clinton would 
have us believe. Wage growth con-
tinues to suffer because of stagnant 
worker productivity. 

throu'" tile whole 
till..., spouting 

If you happened to watch the 
debate on Sunday, you probably 
would agree with comments made 
by a focus group assembled by 
Reuters, One group member com-
plained, "What I found in the 
debate was the candidates seemed 
to be speaking what we already 
knew about almost every issue." 
The bottom line: Each candidate 
sounded like his own tired cam-
paign ads, Said another group 
member, "They say they've got a 
tax plan; tell me how they're going

would even bother 
to check. 

Violent crime is down, but was 
it a nationwide crime blitz coordi -
nated by the White House tha.t 
made America safer? No. It was the 
efforts of states and communities 
enforcing laws like "three strikes" 
that brought the crime rate down. 

Clinton likes to throw around 
the claim that he passed legislation 
(overthe objections of the 1993-94 
Republican minority in Congress) 

to do it. They say they've put 100.000 police on the 
streets; show me where they are." 

Disingenuosity was the dominant theme Sunday 
nighl . Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton played on 
people's fears about unemployment and eco~omic 
uncertainty. Clinton's campaign strategy was, to the 
immortal words of adviser James Carville. "I\'s the 
economy, stupid!" 

Although the economy was just recovering rrom a 
significant recession during 1992, unemployment lev-
els (which are usually the last things to bounce back 
after a recession) remained stubbornly high, Clinton 
played the I-feel-your-economic-pain card to the 

to put 100,000 more police on the streets. But where 
does the money to pay for these additional officers 
come from? It comes out of the pockets of individuals 
like you and me, which means that Washington is 
deciding that they're going to take your money to pay 
for more police officers for cities which are in states 
richer in electoral vOles than yours is. 

Another Clinton whopper was the claim that he 
reduced ''the federal government to its smallest size in 
30 years." So the government is smaller now than it 
was at the start of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society?

Thursday, October 10, 1996' The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

COMMENTARY: Despite limited enrollment and resources, the Religious Studies program is a valuable part of 
UCSD's academic environment, and students ignore what it has to offer at their own intellectual peril 

RELIGIOUS STUDIES MERITS CAMPUS SUPPORT 
By~onC"'" 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

Would you ever consider major-
ing in religiou sludies.or possibly 
making It your career'? Did you 
even know that UCSD has a reli-
gious studies program') It 's not su r-
prising if your an wers to both 
these questions are "no," because 
none of the UC campuses - with 
the exception of UCSB - has a 
completely estab lished religious 
studies department. 

Like the other campuses, UCS D 
on ly has an interd isciplinary pro-
gram, Reli gious studies majors 
take courses from a vari ety of 
departments, such as history, phi-
losophy, literature or sociology. In 
fact, students in the major can take 
any class that has at least some reli-
gious content. 

However, these students face 
several problems. For example, the 
three core classes that all majors 
have to take are seldom offered 
because the program lacks faculty 
members to teach them regularly. 
This makes it difficult for majors to 
graduate on time. 

As if things couldn't get worse, 
the program was almost 'phased out 
last year even though there were 
still many students majoring in 
religious studies. 

After a year with no department 
secretary, a part-time secretary was 
hired last year to accomplish the 
task of restarting the program.

Religious tudies majors immedi-
ately bombarded her with ques-
tions about whether they could 
complete their core require ment 
thi s year. This part-time secretary 
mu st do her job wi th minimal 
fund and support from the admin-
istrati on. 

Another concern is that the 
quality of the prog ram suffers 
because of these limited resources. 
The three core classes are supposed 
to cover numerous religiou tradi-
tions, One of these c lasses, HITO 
101. can only devote a third of the 
quarter to each of the th ree major 
Western religions: Judai sm, 

Chri st ia~ ity and Islam. Each of 
these religions could be majors 
them elves. 

I'm not cri ticizing the faculty. 
They are great at what they teach. 
The Judai c Studies program here is 
probably one of the best in the 
country. It includes one of the most 
distinguished biblical scholar in 
the world, David Noel Freedman, 
While the Religious Studies pro-
gram is committed to adding a 
New Testament scholar, many 
other religions and aspects of reli -
gions are ignored. 

The administration is not at 
fault for failing to support the 
Religious Studies program ade-
quately. According to Professor 
Paul Sallman, former Revelle 
provost and vice chancellor, UCSD 
intentionally focused on larger,

and wisdom, things

more comprehensive departments 
during it s inception, The idea was 
that smaller programs could draw 
from larger ones, eliminating com-
petition among many small depan-
ments and enabling them to work 
together to provide programs on an 
as-needed basis. 

The reason the Reli gious 
Studies program receive minimal 
funding is because students do not 
show enough interest. The most 
interesting question is why people 

tooay feel there is no need to study 
religion. 

Many st uden ts have religious 
affi liations or arc a part of a reli -
gious organization nn campus, yet 
only a small minority choose to 
study religion. I don'l undersland 
why thi s is the case. 

Maybe they f.:ar that taking rel i-
gion course ' in a 'ccular school 
will challenge thei r faith . On the 
conl rary. the experts teaching thc 
classes, who have spent their li vcs 
studyi ng religion, will make th ..: m 
think aboul what they hclieve, help 
them understand how their reli bion 
came to believe what it doc and 
hel p them gain more underst::ndi ng 
of their re ligious tradit ion ir com-
parison wi th others. One c:m only 
sland to learn from these experi -
ences in religion courses. 

The most important rl:ason why 
more people don' t study religion is 
economic - there i ' little money 
and few job opportunities in reli -
gion. Still. our safest investments 
are in humanity. Those who love 
and seek God with all their heart 
and soul should also seek God with 
their minds through study. 
Understanding each other 's beliefs 
will not only help us strengthen our 
own faiths, but will also help us 
love one another through under-
standing. 

Not on ly can inter-religious 
compat ibi lity be ac hieved. but 
there i ' also the possibi lity for 

peace to be mad..: hetween agnostic 
sc ientists and re li gion. Prof.:ssnr

not true that government regulates

the federal tax code is simpler or 
that government spends les~ than it 
did in the I 960s. (As a percentage

according to a recent study by

Institute of Technology (reported 
in the July 27, 1996, issue of Tile 
Economist), govemment regulates 
more than ever. Costs of comply-

tions cost the economy at least 
$668 billion in 1995. compared 
with $654 billion (inflation-adjust-
ed) in 1977_ 

Not to be outdone. Dole made 
up for Clinton's slipshod use of sta-
tistics by demagoguing the issue of 
drug use. Dole took the president 
to task for increased drug use 
among young people. Dole and his 
campaign advisers have been hit-
ting the drug issue hard for several 
rcasons. First, pollsters in the Dole 
campaign sWear that the drug issue 
is t hc key to c10si ng thc gender

recent drug use has gone from 
around 5 percent to more than 10 
percent. 

Really, though, is it Clinton 
who's respon ible for this inaease 
in drug use? Has he eonspirt.d with 
the CIA in a program to distribute 
drugs to school children? Certainly 
nol. Some would blame Clinton 's 
wink-wink-nod-nod admission of 
pa t marijuana use as sending the 
wrong message to young people. 
But do young people do drugs 
because they think that President 
Clinton thinks it's okay? Definitcly 
not. 

During the I 980s, Nancy 
Reagan 's " Just Say No" campaign 
was credited with reducing drug 
use among young people. 
However, it wasn't the effort coor-
dinated in Washington that keep 
teen drug use low. It was the efforts 
of parents and concerncd members

in the framework spawned by Mrs. 
Reagan who took steps to make

search for in this university. 

While each person has a differ-
ent way of seeking these things, the 
more perspectives we gain, the eas-
ier one is able to see God. Whether 
we study the perspective that is 
Kant's, Einstein'S, Kafka's ,

has a view on God. whether they

sure thiitteens didn't use drugs. 
So if you weren't interested in 

seeing just how disingenuous the 
candidates could be, then Sunday's 
debate wasn't worth watching. The 
candidates muddled their way 
through the whole thing, spouting 
wanned-over advertising copy fed 
to them by their oh-so-expert 
media handlers and trading statis-
tics that they knew few Americans 
would even bother to check. 

Bob Dole even forgot what he'd 
said during his acceptance speech 
in San Diego. In August, he said, ". 
want to be a bridge to the past" [n 
Hartford, he said, " [ want to be a 
bridge to the future_" Do the candi -
dates mean or remember anything 
they say? Or will they just say any-
thing to get elected? [ think my 
opinion is obvious. 

The moral of Sunday's debate? 
If you ' re looking for candidates

really does? Expand your horizons

Increased interest, decreased

only way to keep our Religious 
Studies program going. Express 
more interest in and demand for 
Religious Studies classes so we can

ATO_C: Lecky 
says whale deaths are 
just a coincidence 
Continued from page 1 
on marine mammal. 

The time e lapsed as the 
sOl:ndwaves tra vel from the source 
to a receiver is relevant because 
sound travels faster in warm water 
than in cold water . The experiment-
ers at SIO CUil accurately determine 
ocean temperatures using these 
times. Information gathered about 
the ocean temperatures will be used 
to judge whether the earth is indeed 
experiencing a "greenhouse effect." 

While many environmentalists are 
particularly interested in identi fying a 
global warming trend, they are now 
concerned with the effect of sound 
transmissions on marine life. After 
the acoustic source was installed off 
theCalifomia coast last October, three 
whales were found dead. 

After the National Marine Fisher-
ies Service (NMFS). the U.S. Coast 
Guard, and the National Parks Ser-
vice were unable to retrieve the whale 
carcasses to perform autopsies, the 
NMFS office of Protected Resources 
conducted an investigation to deter-
mine the cause of the whales' deaths. 

Afterweighing the possibilities-
such as disease and biotoxic poison-
ing - Jim Lecky, chief of the pro-
tected species divi ion of the NMFS, 
came to the condusion that the whale 
dea hs were purely coincidental with 
the project. Accordingly, ATOC was 
allowed tocontinuebroadcasting from 
theCalifomia source in early Decem-
ber of last year. 

Despite these reservations. the 
Underwater Land Permit from 
Hawaii's Department of Land and 
Natural Resources, for which the 
project had been wai ting since 
March of 1994. was recently granted. 

As part of the initial transmis-
sions from the Hawaii installation , 
scienti sts from the ATOC Marine 
Mammal Research Program will be 
aboard the ship conducting acoustic 
and vi sual monitoring of marine 
mammals in the area. If a large scale 
response is seen, the transmissions 
are to be terminated in accordance 
with the permits under which the 
project is operating. 

At this time of year, few animals 
should be seen. Additionally, scien-
tists on board the ships will communi-
cate results of the expcrimen ts and the 
responses of marine life to the public 
and will work to facilitate educational 
opportunities for chi ldren. 

SURVEY: New 
ir.:fo will help staff in 
designing programs 
Continued from page 2 

This information is particularly 
important to library staff as they 
begi n to design future programs 
and utilize growing technological 
resources. 

Talbot commented that the re-
sults of the first survey were "en-
couraging" and gave the library 
staff ideas about which areas they 
need to work on. 

She also stressed thaI the staff 
is very responsive to student input 
and welcome comments and sug-
gestions. 

Pleased with the success of the 
first urvey, the library staff plans 
tocontinue surveying undergradu-
ates every two to three year . in 
order to use the results as a method 
of tracking whether or not the im-
provements to the libraries are well 
received.

THE DOROTHY DAY STORY 
Dorothy Day, one of 

the most influential 
human rights activists of 
the twentieth century, 
underwent remarkable 
transformation through-
out her lifelime. "Enter-
talntng Angels: The 

Dorothy Day Story" - starring Moira 
Kelly in the role of Day and Martin 
Sheen as Day 's mentor Peter Maurin -
presents her life from the time he was a 
journali st in the 1920" and '30s and 
engaged in scandalous love affairs and 
led radical ociali t demonstrations, to 
her dedication to the poor, Catholicism 
and non-violent conflict resolution. 

The brainchild of producer Father Ell-
wood Keiser (the director of "Romero"), 
"Entertaining Angels" began a a movie-
of-the-week idea following Day 's death 
in 1980. Keiser, who befriended Day 
through their work in the Catholic 
.church, held on to the project ever since. 

, The film, already released in New York 
and Los Angeles, will open at the AMC 
Mission Valley 20 theater tomorrow. 

In interviews with the GUQrrJian, Kelly 
and Keiser spoke about the portrayal of 
Day and her coming-or-age story. 

Gu.rdi.n: How did 
you prepare for your 
role? 

Kelly: A lot of research, 
a lot of reading. I visi ted 
the Catholic Worker in 
Philadelphia and talked to 
people who met Dorothy 
Day. 
Will people be able to 
relate to Dorothy 
Day's character? 

Some things r rom her 
life para llel. Mostly her 
journey, I believe. She was 

Guardian: Why did 
you decide to a biog-
raphy on Dorothy 
Day? 

Keiser: Well, I knew 
Dorothy at the Vatican 
council in 1965. She was 
over there to lobby the 
bi hops on the strongest 
possible condemnation of 
nuclear warfare. and I was 
over there as a correspon-
dent. And so we became 
friends. And I knew that 

such a human figure and 
she went through so many 
things that most human 
beings go through, trying 
to fi gure oul their lives and 
where they want to be 
directed. Her ~trugg le s are 
very similar to a lot of peo-
ple\. 
Do you think Dorothy 
Day's perceived dif· 
ferently, now that 
she's a part of histo-
ry? 

Yes . I mC;ln . at that 

she was a great woman, a 
compassionate woman, a 

~trong woman. a woman 
especially dedicated to the 
poor. I didn't know, how-
ever, where she' d come 
from. When you get into 
her whole life, Dorothy 
was a fei sty, street-smart 
Mother Theresa and I 
guess somebody who wa

The Ghost and the Darkness 
Kilmer and Douglas hunt lions in Africa . 

By Terry Lew 
Senior Staff Writer 

If you've ever thought that 
trfith really is stranger 
than fi(;tion, you might 
he interested in Val 
Kilmer and Mi(;hael 
Douglas' new movie 
"The Ghost and the 
Darkness." 

The lilrn is a true 
story about two atypi(;ul 
lions who brought the 
British empin: 's plans for East 
Afm:a to a saeeching halt. Lt. 

Colonel John Pallerson (played by 
Kilmer) was scntto Africa in 1896 
to build a bridge over the Tsavo 

River, the final link in a 
580-mile railway that 
would secure British 
interests in the lucrative 
East African ivory trade. 

Pallerson had wanted 
to go to Africa all hi s 
life, but he was unpre-
pared for whal awaitcd 
him thl.re. His very first 

day, a lion all acked and killed a 
man in the village of Tsavo, 

which means "a place of slaugh-
ter" in Swahili . Patterson took it 
upon himself to protect the vil-
lagers and workers, and he killed 
the lion that night with a single 
shot. 

That shot, however, did not 
end the bloodshed . Work pro-
gressed well for a time, but soon 
enough the terror began anew. The 
two new lions were fearless, and 
they had an um:anny way of 
knowing ju t where and when to 
allack.

Surviving Picasso 
Hopkins, as Picasso, portrays 
artist's tormented relationships 

By Dominique Nunez 
Guardian Reporter 

Renowned for films u(;h as "A 
Room with a View" and 
"Howa rd" End," the 
di rcctori ai/p roducti on 
team Merc hant Ivory 
brings to the Sl: reen, 
"Surviving Pi ca 0," the 
story of Franeiose Gilot 
and her rocky ten-year 
relationship with Pablo 
Picasso. 

The movie begins at 
the tail -end of World War II. Picas-
so, played by Anthony Hopkins, 
has by this time earned celebrity 
status in the art world , as well as 
an infamous reputation in hi s rela-
tionship with women. Far beyond 
his prime, Pica so still manages to 
attract the attentions of young 
aspiring female painters. Enter 
Gilot. 

The film emphasizes Picasso's 
dominance over those who sur-
round him . Picasso's traditional 
Spanish roots prompt him to seek 
equality in the camaraderie of 
men, while his lack of regard for 
women is exemp lified throughout 
the film. While there is no doubt 
that Picasso said such things, the 
British Hopkins lacks in Iberian 
ruggedness and plays it off as stoic 
dialogue. He gives the audience 

only a vague idea of who Picasso 
really was. However, the imagery 
within each scene does evoke 
Picasso's different artistic move-

ments . 
To its credit, the film 

cleverly portrays Picas-
so's past through Fran-
ciose's narrati on. he 
has gathered bits and 
pieces of hi past and 
formed her own version 
of the sto ry . Hopkin's 
Picasso in these scenes 

works because Franciose's is 
telling the story. 

Gilot allempts to garner both 
compa ion and inspiration as she 
escapes her relationship with 
Pica so virtually unscathed. Fran-
ciose' encounters with Picasso's 
mentally anguished past loves 
clearly demonstrate the danger she 
faced of losing meaning in her 
own life. 

However, the experiences of 
Picasso 's first wife, Olga 
Khokhol va (played by Jane 
Capotaire) and Doramaar (played 
by a metamorphosed Julianne 
Moore), become more fasc inating 
than Franciose's personal story. 

Unwilling to be the story of a 
women 's quest for · self-reliance, 
the film becomes a mundane look 
into the world of Picasso.

Continued from page 9 
what kind of impact it was making 
on people. 
Why did you dec:ide to take 
on this role? 

It·s a female role with real guts, 
and it 's a great story that needed to 
be told. 1t 's a wonderful challenge 
for an actor to portray this lady, and 
I believed in her and her story. 
How does this compare with 
other work you've done? 

It 's a slice of lifc. All my roles 
are . I can had her on 10 my list of 
characters. This one's definitely 
difrerenl from anything I've ever 
done before. and she's son of the 
spiritual lice of life thaI I had yet 
to ponray. I also haven' t played too

how to do It. And linally. great suf-
fering. She experienced God at the 
bOltom, in suffering, and carne out 
the other side seeing that her fulfill -
ment and her happiness were 
bound up in finding God, and the 
best way to find God was in help-
ing the poor. 
Did you .peak to Dorothy 
Day about doing a biography 
on her life before she died? 

I went to her in about 1978, and 
I asked for permiss ion to tell her 
story. She rather gruffly said, "Wait 
until I'm dead." And so I did. 
Do you think she'd be happy 
with the picture now? 

That was something I had in the 
back of my head the entire time we 
were shooting. We began the shoot 
with a mass, and during thai mass I 
told the people, "Let's make a pic-
ture worthy of the woman ." A great 
woman deserves a great picture and 
we wanted to work very hard to 
give it to her. The cast and crew 
both worked very hard and I think 
we came up with something very 
special. We think it's an exception-
al picture, and I got the picture I 
wanted .

with M.nin Sheen? 
I loved it. He 's a fine man, and 

quite an activist himself. He had 
met Dorothy Day at the Catholic 
Worker in New York , and he was 
wonderful at giving me somc 
insight on whal that was like. He 
was also beauliful with the cast, 
just very down to earth. A lot of 
Fun . Hc's such a fine actor that I 
was ort of awe ·truck in the firsl 
couple of day s. 
How did Peter Maurin influ· 
ence Dorothy Day? 

Peter Maurin was the eer, the 
thinker. Dorothy had a lot of differ-
ent ideas but didn't know how to 
make them work. He took all the e 
ideas that she had and formulated 
them . and put her to work . She 
needed him very much to accom-
plish what he wanled to at.:com-
plish . He was the first one 10 actu-
ally introduce her to the life of the 
poor, as far as living it and not just 
reaching out to it. because he him-
se lf was a peasant and a poor man. 

What type of rnesNge do 
you hope to deliver in this 
film? 

The biggest message I hope the 
film delivers i one, to be honest 
wi lh yo u, I think that your genera-
tion needs to hear. It is that we are 
capable of not only self-discovery, 
self-knowledge , se lf-acceptance 
bUllhat we are capable of self- tran-
scendence and are capable of car-
ing for something -0 much that we 
are willing to give our lives for it. 

Dorothy Day symbolizes that. 
This is a woman totally committed 
to the ervice of the poor, totally 
committed to the non-violent reso-
IUlion of conflict. and she gives her 
life for that. Our culture tends to be 
narciss isti c. tends to be self-
involved, lends to be hung up on 
self-fulfillment. 

I think Dorothy's a saint. but I 
also lhink he's a prophet. Fifty or 
sixty years ago. she was dealing 
with i sues that our whole cu Iture 
is struggling with today, like exu-
ali ty and commillment , like si ngle 
motherhood, like abortion, like the 
search for the transcendent. Li ke 
the service of the poor, like the 
homeless issue, like non-violent 
conflict resolution. She was a 
woman ahead of her time, coming 
up with very human and Christian 
solutions to problems our whole 
culture is struggling with.

Virtually Normal 
Sullivan presents argument about homosexuality 

.By Brend .. Turrill 
Guardian Reporter 

From the views of prohibition-
ists to those of liberals. Andrew 
Sullivan thoroughly analyzes the 
different reactions of 
various socially-formed 
groups in response to the 
issue of homosexuality 
in hi s new book. entitled 
VirtllalLy Normal :. An 
Argument Abolll Homo-
sexllality. 

The book does not 
attempt to ex pl ai n homo-
sexualit y. hut rather it puts forth a 
very well -developed. intellectual 
argume nt that goes to the ve ry root 
of four different types of social 

idealism. The four social groups 
that Sullivan 's argument is struc-
tured around arc: the Prohibition-

method. Sullivan cri ti-

er with hi stori cal and

throughout , thus making it a very 
intriguing and educating work. 

After givi ng the reader numer-
ou ~ insightful observat ions on thc 

various reac tions to homosexuali -
ty in society, Sullivan suggests a 
"politic of homo exuality." This 
notion of a "politics of homosexu-
ality" involves the marriage of the 
mo t valid arguments given to us 
by both conservatives and libera ls. 
This marriage of ideas would seck

not deny homosexuals thei r exi -

had ever hunted. They attacked 
relentlessly and viciously in ways

Hopkins' talent does not end 
with scenery. The camerawork dur-

Discovering Ellis Ruley 
Self-taught painter's exhibit opens in San Diego

Staff Writer 

"During the first hour of a flea

when we first laid eyes 
on Adam and Eve . I 
couldn ' t believe th e 
power of the picture. it

just poor people that enjoyed 
thei r su rroundings. At that time 
- you think back - what could 
a black man do? How much 
money could he make? And 
where cou ld he li ve?" 

In his ,day, Ellis Ruley was 
regarded as a socia1 stigma. not a

during the ea rl y 1900's, 
he was a target of

Ruley's financial 
wealth and interracial 
marriage made him a 
rote model for some, 
and an enemy for oth-

A common laborer and the son 
of a runaway slave, Ruley was 
never granted the luxury of for-
mal art training. Born on Decem-

age of 57 that hi s career as an 
artist began. 

Keep in mind that the orwich 
KKK was still holding meetings 
during the ea rl y 1980's. Yet 
despite the day to day confl ic t he 
faced, Ruley found a means 10 
express his exq uisite perception 
of reality and paradi~c. 

With on ly postcrboard and 
common housepaint as his prima-

Play On! -
Shakespeare meets Ellington in musical 

By Pamela Hardy

War-cra Harlem comes

in "Play On! ," currently pla)-
ing at the Old

"Play On l " is the 
hit of thc season, 
combining thc 
humor of hake-
speare'!, comedy 
"Twelfth ight" 
with the brilliant 
songs of Dukc Ellington, fca-
turing many hits ("Take thc A 
Train," "It Don ' t Mean a 
Thing if It Ain't Got That 
Swing") and some of his less-
er-known treasures. The story 
is based on a book by Cheryl 
L. West, playwright of "Jar the 
Floor" and "Puddi n 'n Pete," 
and, like her other shows, fea-
tures an all-black cast. 

Conceived and directed by

also directed 
"Blues in the 

ight," which toured in terna-
tionally and was nOll!inated 
for a "bcst musica l" Tony 
Award. 

The show fea tures an out-

Broadway veterans. ''The

Particularly notable is 

his use of imagery of the 
hunt and nature as a means 
to express race relations. 

As violence becomes an 
issue within his work, ani-
mals are depicted as cor-
nered or confronting dan-

Satchel's Soul 
Seattle band strays from grunge rock 

By Esther Yoon 
Hiatus Editor 

While Satchel hai ls from 
Seallie and produced it s 
newest album, "The Fami ly," 
with Pearl Jam gui -
tarist Stone Gos-
sard, the band 's 
oulful , pensive 

sty le is a far cry 
from grunge. 

Rather, Satchel 
backs the beautiful 
vocals of lead 
singer Shawn 
Smith with his pi ano and the 
sound of chirping birds, into 
a tight pop-rock style which 
evokes a teary, billersweet 
melancholy. 

Currently on tour wi th 

Beller Than Ezra, Satchel's 
ex tended "family" includes 
Smith (who also sings occa-
sionally for the Afghan 
Whigs, his other two band 

Brad and Pigeon-
head and was inci-
dentally named 
one of the 50 be t 
singers ever by 
MOJO magazine), 
drummer Regan 
Hagar (also of 
Brad, as well as 
Malfunk s hun ), 

guitarist John Hoag and 
bassist Mike Berg. 

In an interview wilh the 
Guardian, Hagar described 
the band's musical innuence 
and currcnt tour with Beller 

Than Ezra. 
Satchcl will perform with 

Beller Than Ezra and James

Hagar: The stuff we li s-

OJ Spooky 
Songs of a Dead ... 

-••• 

OJ Spooky, also known as Paul 
Miller, performs at roving under-
ground parties in New York City 
and keeps busywith several other 
projects - ranging from a novel, to 
a one man art how. to his recent 
West Coast tour. Songs of a Dead 
Dreamer is Spooky's first album, 
fusing elements of diverse music 
forms and ideas to fonn a un ique 
whole. 

Seeking to break down the barri-
ers that inevitably restrict mu ic 
genres to certain specific bound-
aries. Spooky plays with each style. 
blurring the borders by which it is 
defined. breaking it dOwn into its 
basic components. and mixing those 
individual parts with those of other 
style . The most recognizable 
sources pf Spooky's inspiration are 
dub, hip-hop. ambient. jungle. and 
an eclectic mix of world music. 

The result of this synthesis is a 
tripped-OUt concept of music and 
experimentation that will not fail to 
surprise. This tyle may ~ appeal 
to some, but for those who think this 
sounds interesting or who love to 
trip out on sonic textures and 
effects. Songs of a Dead Dreamer 
will satisfy.

Ocean CoIoIr Scene 
Mossley Shoals 

-
**** 

From Blur to Ash. and Oasis to 
Ela tica. England has produced 
many hip tunes about the vagaries of 
modem English life. However. 
Ocean Colour Scene, with their bril-
liant debut. Moseley Shoals, shou ld 
give the indie Brit-pop scene some-
thing new to talk about. 

Bringing back a style more asso-
ciated wi th the Stone RoseS. these 
blokes somehow mix the tu nes of 
classic British rock, i.e. the Roll ing 
Stone . • with a touch of l imi Hen-
drix. Songs like "40 Past Midnight" 
or "Ri verboat Song" manage to 
make one high-as-a-kite without 
having to touch a bowl. 

These tunes stray from the loud 
sounds of pseudo-alternative music. 
and soulfully express the sentiments 
of love. pain and fame. An emotion-
al disconnection pervades when 
Simon Fowler sings. "If I were a 
king & you were a lady/what would 
I sing to say what I'm saying/and 
would you believe the versus left 
open/my heart on my sleeve the 
rhyming all broken." 

Whether or not the '90s will 
accept the Ocean Colour Scene's 
old-fashioned jam. they're still 
bloody good.

B-Sharp JIll IMItaI 
Searching for the One 

-•••• 

According to Herb Graham. Jr .• 
founder and drummer of the L.A.-
based B-Sharp Jazz Quartet, "Jazz 
has lost its balls." In its latest release. 
hi s band challenges thi s stereotype 
by offering up a cutting-edge acid 
jazz sound. 

In Searching for the Olle, the 
straight-ahead jazz group integrates 
alternative rock. funk. thrash metal 
and spoken word. The album signi-
fi e part of the. rebirth of a donnant 
jazz scene in Lo Angeles. in which 
B-Sharp l: reates, follows and leads 
in its free-fonn tyle. 

Seorr:hing for the One is punctu-
ated by spoken word perfonnances 
from L.A. poet Kamau Dahood and 
lyrical meditation. "Liemert Park" 
marks a soulful paean to the Los 
Angeles neighborhood that has 
become a breeding ground for' the 
city:s African-American artists. 

The albums intro piece "Spirit of 
Jazz Today" is not alone in its per-
ambulations through the mind. The 
powerful spoken poetry of Kamau 
adds another dimension to the song 
and the album. 

The ·B-Sharp Jazz Quartet will 
perfonn at the UCSO Jazz Coffee-
house series on Sunday at 7:30 p.m.

The Tedlnlc:al Jed 
The Oswald Cup 
.,-TR_ 

-• •• 

Only two short years after their 
first li ve show and the relea e of 
just a few recordings, The Techni-
called validate its hardcore talent 
on its first full -length album. The 
Oswald CUI' . 

The mismatched and seemingly 
incompatible pasts of the band 
members (who met while working 
at an oriental rug store) permeate the 
hard-driving sound resonant of The 
Techn ica l Jed. 

Their generational. regional. and 
indi vidual idiosyncrasies fuse into a 
discordant. bold ound. The ener-
getic. hard-core tracks featured on 
The Oswald Cup are definitely inno-
vative and are worthy of special 
note. 

However. the slower. more 
melodic songs on the album lack the 
intensity and experimental nature 
t hat the band is c1earl y capable of 
when they generate pummeling 
drum beats and more rapid tempos. 

Nevertheless. The Technical 
Jed creates a surprisingly intrigu-
ing debut album which will 
undoubtedly become the founda-
tion on which this foursome will 
create even greater things in the 
future .

Soul On Ice 
Pr ..... _ 

-..... 

Since the summer of '94, L. A.-
based rapper Ra Kass has been 
widely regarded as the sav ior of 
true hip-hop on the West Coast. 
With singles now deemed by many 
as underground classic (such as 
"Won' t Catch Me Runnin n • and 
"Remain Anonymous"). Ras was 
seen as one of the most gifted Iyri -
ci ts on th is side of the country. as 
well as blessed with phat under-
ground beats laid down by his part-
ner Bird. Coupled wit h Bird's pro-
duction and his membe rship in the 
now-defunct rh yme crew Western 
Hemi sfear, Ras Kass epitomi 7..ed 
true hip-hop with his unique style. 

One would expect that Ras' 
solo debut would be deemed a 
bona-fide hip-hop classic, but in 
the two years that have passed. 
many rappers have ass imilated hi s 
entire style. Soul On Ice doesn't 
quite surpass his early work , nor 
that of other emcees since then. 

At the time of his debut work. 
what made Ras Kass stand out 
from the re t of all 'he G-funked-

our ongs that remind me of the 
bands that we grew up with. I think 
that we' re pretty unique. We're 
kind of mellow, but kind of inter-

Shawn sounds a lot like Ste-
YIe Wonder on some of the 
aonp from The F.mily. 

We li stened to lots of Stevie 
Wonder. We love Stevie Wonder 
and Prince and a lot of R&B. But 
we don ' t con<ciously take our 
inOuences from them. We grew up 
li stening to this, so our music tends 
10 lean back more on when we were 
kids than on current music. 
What influenced you to take 
such a pensive tone on the

the rain in Seattle. 
Why are people in Seattle 
50 depresaed? 

They arc depressed. It 's the rain 
or something, I gues . Seattle has 
the highest suicide rate in the coun-
try. And then, you know, with the 
whole coffee th ing up there ... There 
was somebody at the Uni ver ity of 
Washington who did a study on 
that, and apparently the uicide rate 
has dropped 'ince the espresso 
ex plosion. It makes people happier, 
like cups of sunshine. 
Are )'OU going to perform 
any harder songs in your 
set? 

We do a couple of hard songs 
every night. But it 's primarily 
piano on Ihis tour. When we LOured 

The UCSD Guardian 

for the last record we only did two 
piano songs, and now we do proba-
bly seven out of ten. 
How is the new album dif· 
f.rent from S.'che', the 
debut? 

The last one was basically three 
years worth of songs thrown 
together, and that can never really 
happen again, because it 's every-
thing we were writing before our 
record dea l. And now, when wc' re 
off tour for three weeks, we' ll go 
and make a record. The new record 
has morc of a theme than the last 
one, and I think it's basica lly 
because it was all wrinen during 
the samc time period. 
To what kind of audiences 
does Satchel cross over? 

I don' t know. I think that' s 
where we have a hard time. We like 
so many different things, and our 
music doesn't really fo llow any of 
those things that we really Ii kc. 
People who are into us tend to be 
people who rea lly like albums, as 
opposed to people who arc interest-

~upport Satchel are music- lovers 
who get into the enu re album and

verses about anything from 
"keepin' it real" in hip-hop to

realization that a West Coast rap-

Stanford Invites UCSD, But Isn't Hospitable PUCK: Here is the Bible of ice 
Continued from pep 28 CARDINAL: The Tritons traveled to the Stanford Invitational, where the men finished third overall . 

By Kevin McUuchHn 
Staff Writer 

The beat goes on for the Triton 
cross country team, as last weekend 
saw the runners sprint through a 

successful competi. 
tion at the Stanford 
University Invita-
tional. 

Continuing to 
pace the men's team 
were star junior 
Gavin Klinger and 
learn captain Rhodes 
Walton . Klinger 

placed fifth overall, laking top hon-
orson the team again, while Walton 
finished next in 171h place. Neal 
Harder "wasdefinitelyachampion," 
in the words of Triton Head Coach 
Ted Van Arsdale, as he fini hed 
trongly despite incurri ng a 

sidestitch cramp at the two-mile 
mark, lending motivation to many 
of his teammates. 

The meet also consisted of a " tre-
mendous performance" from sopho-
more Franzwa Achie. Despite never 
having run previously on the 
Stanford course, Ihe youngster 
showed determination and season-
ing beyond his years in finishing 
fifth on the team, helping the men to 
finish third as a group. 

The women runners had a 
rougher go of it, placing 10th over-
all. Meghan. Scott led the team, 
gamering 'Tri ton of the Week" la-
tus along with Walton, while lenny 
Card ran j ust behind her in second 
place on the Triton squad. A suc-
cessful cross country team is built 
on consi tency of performance, and 
according to Van Arsdale, these

women have been "two consistent 
performers on a regular basis." 

Notwithstanding the men's suc-
cess, the team's performance should 
continue to improve. Brian Leek, 
who finished fourth, was battling 
sickness as he ran, while Harder 
dealt with his setback. 

According to Achie, "some guys 
were already tired from the night," 
and the travel caused many Tritons 
to pare down their preparation be-
fore they ran. Though they've done 
very well, the team isstilliooking 10 
put together a complete group ef-
fort. 

"If everyone has a race where 
we ' re all on, we' ll do really well in 
gearing up for nationals." Klinger 
aid. 

Van Arsdale echoed the theme 
of continued improvement, say ing 

"You learn a lot from racingexperi-
ences, and our team right now is like 
a sponge; they're soaking up every-
thing we give them." 

The team right now is shaping up 
as hoped, with both the men and 
women coming together as two of 
the best teams in the conference, 
and the best Western team in Divi-
sion III competition. This Saturday 
wi II include an on-campus competi-
tion where the Tritons will run in the 
more traditional format of a two-
team race wfth UC Irvine. 

This competition should include 
more team racing strategy than pre-
vious meets, and wi II be another 
step in the maluration process of the 
Triton runners . 

"]fyou learn, you are going 10 be 
uccessful down the road," Van 

Arsdale aid.

Fights break out as often as a 
bowler sips from his beer. These 
quarrels are not about two men 
showing off their macho bravado. 
The instigators fights are flexing 
their muscle or coming to the res-
cue of a fellow teammate who has 
been wronged in the field of play. 

Hockey is a game of contradic-

graceful, fluid show of balance,

ankle. That same ankle broke during his 
freshman eason at UCSD, finally 
requiring urgery last year. 

From there, his list of injurie is as 
long as t he line at Soft Reserves. 
Kosakoff tore ligaments in his knee his 
sophomore year at Torrey Pines, broke 
his arm a year later and tore his quadri-
eep' muscle in his second year at UCSD. 

Presently, Kosakoff is playing with a 
brace on his wrist due to a fracture and 
sprain sustained in the Tritons' victory 
againsl Chapman last week. 

"It seems like every time 1 kept doing 
better and beuer or feeling stronger and 
stronger, that's when my injury hit," 
Kosakoff said. 'That for me i$ the hard-
est part because it's really frustrating 
knowing that you're trying so hard to get 
back to where you were and then some-
thing else happens." 

Plowing through his injuries, 
Kosakoff managed to be high on the 

recruitment list of schools like UC 
Berkeley, Stanford and Creighton -
who e program was ranked No. I in the 
nation althe time. 

Kosakoff finally decided to attend 
UC Berkeley, but due to injury, a slow 
start end a poor team record, Kosakoff 
opted to red-shirt hi first semester. 

When Kosakoff returned for his sec-
ond semester. however, he decided thai 
Berkeley wasn't the place for him. He 
jumped on the next plane back to San 
Diego, ending his short-lived career as a 
Golden Bear. 

Going home to San Diego was a 
blessing in disguise for Kosakoff. He 
returned to the Nomads to play alongside 
Hetherington again, and future UCSD 
teammate, Jose Ocampo, under the 
instruction of Armslrong. 

"[Kosakoff) is a very, very good play-
er," Armstrong said. "He has always 
been a skill full player, and I'd rather see 
him [at midfield)." 

A college education was still an aspi-
ration for Kosakoff, and Armstrong 
offered him that education, and the 
opponunity to play soccer at UCSD.

thought he would use UCSD as a step-
ping stone back to a top-division soccer 
school. 

All that changed, however, when the 
men' soccer team won the alional 
Cha:npion hip during hi first year as a 
Triton. After thaI success, Hetherington 
and Ocampo transferred to UCSD, and 
Kosakoff later moved to his present po i-
tion as sweeper. 

'This year, I feel like [sweeper] is a 
good position for me because it's a posi-
tion where I have the best chance of 
making it through the season. without 
major injuries," Kosakoff said. 

As for his post-UC SD plans, 
Kosakoff hopes to someday return to 
school for a master's degree. Until then, 
he wants to get some work experience 
under his belt. 

"From there, I'll play it by ear. If my 
ankles feel good, maybe I'll try to play 
soccer again al some level," Kosakoff 
said. "If not, I'll just be a recreational 
player and pursue whatever career I am 
interested in. Mentally, I 'd love to play 
again, but physically, I don' t know if my 
body can handle being a professional 
soccer player." Student-Athlete: Joel Kosakoff was chosen to the first-team Academic All-American soccer squad last year.

What started 
out as a fout-
year-old's 

r hobby has 
turned into a 
way of life for 
UCSD's Joel

Despite

22-year-old 
senior has 
proven him-
self a stellar ~ 
student and a

sweeper/defenseman for the men's soc-
cer team - which currently boasts a 
nine-game winning streak. 

Wilh all the lime and energy Ihal 
Kosakoff has PUI inlo playing soccer. one 
mighl think that he has not been 
able to dedicale the same aUenlion 
to his academics. But Ihis firsl-
team, Academic All-American ath-
lete with an economics and psy-
chology double major is sporting a 
4.0 GPA, and he will graduate in 
December. 

As for the team. the Tritons are 
in top form, and looking for their 
10th consecutive win this weekend when 
lhey take on Richard Stockton (Nl). To 
date, the leam has allowed only 15 goals. 
compared 10 pUlling in 38 of their own. 

"ThaI 's the thing about Ihis team." 
Kosakoff said. "This leam is definitely 
scoring easier than any of the three teams 
I have played wilh in the past [at 
UCSDI." 

Kosakoff' club career began when he

age of seven. A year later he played for 
the San Dieguito Surf Triple-A team, 
where he first met fellow Triton Nate 
Helheri nglon. 

"If I'm having a problem with how 
I'm playing or if I 'm feeling bad 
about a certain thing. I'd most like-
Iy go to [Hetheringlon) because 
I've known him for so long," 
Kosakoff said. 

"Not only du I respect him a lot 
as a player, but off the fi eld he's a 
really good friend of mine:" 

It wasn't long before Ihe San 
Diego native ,noved to the La lolla 

Nomads. where Kosakoff's team won 
three Slate Cup Championships under 
Trilon women's oceer head coach Bri an 
McManus. 

During his years wi th the Nomads, 
Kusakoff also became acquainted with 
the Soccer expert ise of UCSD's men's 
soccer hcad coach Derek Armstrong. 

"[Armstrong] is a really influential 
guy," Kosakoff said. "Hc's known in lhe 
soccer world and he's a great coach. His 

knowledge of the game is just unbeliev-
able, and he also challenges you 10 make 
you do beller." 

Kosakoff's success on the club scene 
was renecled in his play at Torrey Pines 
High School. Then a midfielder, 
Kosakoff won MOSl Valuable Player hon-
ors bolh his junior and senior seasons. 
and the team won CIF in Kosakoff's final 
year. 

"loel is just a really solid player," 
Hetherington said. "He's confident, he 
works hard and he knows how to play the 
game well. He's a really great player and 
imponant 10 our defense." 

As a senior, Kosakoff was also hon-
ored as League Player of the Year. 
Hetheringlon had captured the same 
award the previous year. 

Despite all ' of the recognilion 
Kosakoff received playing for Torrey 
Pines, il was also the firsl lime he faced

Westmont Whack UCSD CLUB SPORTS ROUND-UP 
LET-DOWN: After capturing the Mizuno Invite 
Title, UCSD dropped a 5-set match at Westmont 
By Steve Walsh 
Cc>-Associate Sports Editor 

Coming off a dramatic weekend in 
which the women' vollcyball squad 
capiured the Mizuno Invitational 
Championship. Head Coach Duncan 
McFarland hoped the Tritons 
would not run into a classic 
case of post-victory letdown. 
Despitc traveling up the coast 
to Santa Barbara to face NAIA 
power Westmont College. the 
Tritons showed no sign of re-
laxing as they lost a hard-
fought. five-game battle to the 
Warriors. 

"]t was a struggle. We had an off-
match." McFarland said . "We 
struggled to play consistently but we 
battled," 

Riding the emotional high of their 
tourhament success. the Tritons 
stonnedoutofthegate, taking the first 
two games from their shocked hosts. 
Led by senior outside hitter Mieke 
Biesheuvel and sophomore middle 
blocker Shannon Noonan - both all-
tournament selections at Mizuno -
the Tritons applied pressure to the 
Warrior defense, and took game one, 
15-13. UCSD kept its opponents on 
their heels with much of the same 
intensity throughout the second game 
before iJispatching them, 15- 11 . 

Witlt two games in hand, the Tri-
tons saw some of their intensity slip 
away as they dropped the third game, 
15-3. The fourth game proved to be 

the tightest between the two teams, 
with the game needing extra points to 
be played out before the winner was 
decided, Each team struggled to take 
control of the game before the War-
riors proved to be too much to handle. 

A strong jump serve from 
Westmont , which could not be 
disrupted even with McFarland 
calling two time-outs, put the 
finishing touches on the game, 
16-14. 

"The first two games we 
sort of squeaked by," Noonan 
said, "We weren't doing any-
Ihing special and it gave lhem a 

chance. We just need to be a lillie 
more consistent." 

With both leams locked at two 
games apiece, the fifth and deciding 
game was played under rally scori ng. 
in which a point is scored on each 
serve. Wilhthegamelockedatll - II , 
Westmont proved to be the sironger 
squad that day, and took the match, 
15-12. 

"We're pretty disappointed," se-
nior Madelyn Ripken said, "We had 
beaten them already in the Point Lorna 
Tournament but we just never got into 
a rhythm." 

Biesheuvelled Ihe offense with 22 
kills and Noonan added 16 from her 
frontline position. 

"We knew it was going to be 
tough," Ripken said, "Those are the 
co ts of playing NAJA schools. We 
just need to keep improving." 

Rugby 

To much of the UCSD student 
body, the close t thing to rugby any 
of them might encounter is buying a 

Ihick-striped shi rt at the 
mall. But for a rowdy 

band of pigskinners 
on campus, rugby 
is a passionate way 

oflife. Forthose who are uneducated 
in the European-style game, it can 
best be described as a cross bet ween 
soccer and football, but without the 
lUXUry of pads. 

The UCSD rugby team has shown 
that while San Diego may not be a 
hotbed for Ihe sport, they sure know 
how to play it. Afterfini hingoutlast 
year in seeond place in the Southern 
California Conference, the squad is 
out to put itself at the top of lhe pile. 

"Our goal thi s year is to take first 
place," said sophomore Ryan KOlton, 
"We have a strong retul1)ing squad 
and a number of promising new ad-
ditions." 

Standing in the way of the team 
goal is the squad from ' Claremont-
Mudd-Sc ripps, which defealed 
UCSD for last year's championship 
by winning on penalties. The league 
also includes teams from UC Irvine, 
UCRiversideandCal State San Ber-
nardino. 

The rugby team has been prepar-
ing for the upcoming season wilh 
wann-up events and competitions 
which took place before fall quarter 
began. Over the summer, the team 
captured first place in the Summer 

Seven's Tournament. Recently, the 
squad scrimmaged with the Marines 
from Camp Pendleton and will face 
them in serious competition in late 
November. 

''We're looking forward to han-
dlingall of ourcompetitions," Kotton 
aid, "Rugby gives u a chance to 

lose a lillie blood, have a good time 
and make some great friends." 

On October 19, UCSD Iravels 
to Escondido with the hopes of 
winning the Escondido 10's Tour-
nament for the second consecutive 
year. That tournament will be a 
warm-up foroneofthe team's big-
gestcompeti tions of the year, when 
they take on the University of San 
Diego and San 
Diego State in 
round-robin ac-
tion on Oct. 26. 
Those matche 
wi II take place 
on campus at 
the Warren 
Fields. 

For the 
ruggers, thesea-
so n does not 
span the normal 
three months, 
but ratherbegins 
in mid-October 
and culminates 
in the confer-
ence finals at the 
beginning of 

competitive season that long, the 
veterans of the tearn are able to come 
together and think up some creati ve 
nicknames for their new team mem-
bers. The nicknames ha ve become a 
tradition, and each member has his 
own title, no maller how creative. 

The UCSD rugby team is look-
ing to continue its tradition of suc-
cess and take hold of the champion-
ship that just barely slipped through 
their fingers last year. The majority 
of the campus may nOl know whal a 
"scrum" is, but they are sure to find 
some of the toughest athletes mixing 
it up on the rugby field. And remem-
ber, no pads.

For anyone interested in 
reading about ultimate frisbee 
or fly fishing, this is not for 
you. So just go and learn to 
,..:ay a real sport while I 
pontificate about the greatest 
spectacle known to the sporting 
world: Professional Hockey . 

Hockey is a spon where you 
are required to kate on ice at 
high speeds, fend off 200-pound 
defenders who use wooden 
ticks as sharp weapons to poke 

at your tender ribs, all while 
shooting a rotating disc - the 
size of a biscuit - past a goal 
which is defended by an agile 
stopper - bound and deter-
mined to gobble up any shot that 
comes his way.

For those unfamiliar with the

intriquite strategy and fierce 
competition. Players skate at

their head with a velocity 
unknown in the world of sports.

Bulldogs fought back minutes later 
on freshman Taj Jensen's second tally

the hands of Harish Ramaiya down 
the right sideline. 

Ramaiya looked cross-court and 
fed Bollenbach inside the box and the 
Junior Co-Captain deposited it past

"It's definitely a team game," 
BollenQach said. "We're sti Illearni ng

Freshmen Jason Boettner and Ross 
Mecham added goals for the Tritons, 
UCSD allowing to pull away in the 
fourth quarter. The Tritons outscored 
Redlands 3-0 in the final period of 
play.

The UCSD women's team con-

cluded their longest road trip of the 
year - two games - by finishing 
on a positi ve note last Tuesday night. 
The third-ranked Tritons won their 
third consecutive decision, ousting 
the Cal Baptist Lancers, 5-1 ,on their 
home turf. 

UCSD scored the first goal of the 
contest 25 minutes into the first half,

The speedy forward from
