UCSD simulcast · 

US/Soviet vets talk 
By KATHLEEN SCHOLL. Sra1!Wnter 

On Tuesday, May 7 , a histOric. live 
sate llite simulcast took place between 
Soviet and American W orld War II 
veterans in San Diego and Moscow to 
commemorate the 40th anniversary of 
World W ar II armistice. 

The event was produced by the 
Department of Communications at 
UCSD, the Roosevelt Center for . 
American Policy Studies. in cooperation 
with KPBS-lV, whic h is located at San 
Diego State UniverSity. 

The simulcast. enmled Rem~mbenng 
War brought together allied veterans fro~ both the US and the Soviet Union 
through a satellite hookup "space 
bridge," to view documentanes, feature 
films , photography. music and drama. 
The purpose of this uni~ue pro~m was 
to provide an opponumty for allIed 
veterans of both nations to recall and 
renect upon their wanime experien~es 
and access the war's impact on theIr 
societies. Many of the veter:ans were 
visibly moved during the vldeotap.lng. 

Moderated in the US by Fredenck 
Starr, president of Oberlin College, and 
in the Soviet Union by VladImir Pozner, 
the "space bridge" hookup all,owed . 
audiences In both countries, including 
World War II veterans, histoty teachers, 
civilian officials, historians , war 
correspondents, workers In the home 
front , to experirnce the presentation 
scripted by both countries 
simultaneously. 

"A space bridge: explained Helene 
Keyssar, chair of the Department of 
Communications and producer and co-
executive producer of Remembenng War, 

"is a Soviet term for intercultural 
simulcast. Literally, It mean s long-range 
bridge. What we now represent is the 
space project For the last year the 
Roosevelt Center and the 
Communications Dl1'artment at UCSD 
have been work ing together to develop 
and implement a se ries of space 
bridges." 

Keyssar and Christopher Makins , co-
executive rroducer of the program and 
director 0 international projects for the 
Roosevelt Center, have been working 
directly with the Foreign Relations . 
Department of Gosteleradi.o ~te RadiO 
and lV, which Keyssar saId ts 
"essentially the combination of NBC, 
ABC , CBS and PBS put together." 

Initially, there was some conc~m that 
choosing World War II as a subject for 
the space bridge program. ~u1d " 
provide too many "pohncal pufaUs. . 
HoweVer the Soviets showed Interest In 
the proje~t and meetins-; have going on 
since June 1984, to script and create a 
program on World War II. 

"We wanted to challenge stereotypes 
or misperceptions which each society 
might have of the other," state 
Christopher Makin. -We developed a 
S[Uds Terkel approach, that is to say we 
wanted to look at the war through both 
American and Soviet eyes, but from the 
point of view of ordinal}' people, not 
from the point of view of politicians, 
and so the script basically takes that 
approach. It 's meant to look at the way 
in which two societies reacted to the 
challenge of war, the way in which they

Correlations of injustice 
Yesterday morning we were anxiously infonned that a group of angry 

Mexicanos had leafletted Southern San Diego, stating that if Border 
Patrol Officer Ned Cole was not brought to trial for the April 18 shooting 
of 12-year-old Hubeno Carrillo Estrada, they would begin 
indiscriminantly killing Americans currently staying in Mexico. 

We understand and sympathize with those Mexican citizens who are 
furious that a us government agent would exhibit such cowardly 
beligerence and shoot a young, impoverished boy in the back. For 
District Attorney Edwin Miller to find insufficient grounds to prose utP 
Mr. Cole is very suspicious indeed. Several eyewitnesses to what the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) described as a "rock-
throwing incident" contend that no rocks were thrown and that Agent 
Ned Cole crouched down in a firing position, took careful aim, and 
fired his weapon three times at the 12-year-old. How D.A. Miller came 
to the conclusion that the "narrow restrictions" of California state law 
prohibits him from even opening up the case eludes us. Fear for one's life 
in the midst of a very standard occurrence at the border-a 
confrontation between Mexican youths at play and tense INS agents-
does not wash with us, and, we hope, will not with those in the 
California Supreme Court who take the idea of justice seriously. 

The threats issued to American citizens either living or traveling in 
Mexico, however, do in fact shine more light on what a few of the 
speakers at the UCSD divestment rally on Tuesday were alluding to 
when they spoke of "a direct correlation between United States foreign 
poLicy in South Africa and its policy in other pans of the Third World," 
such as Mexico. Not only is the current Administration's foreign policy 
incongruent with its own rhetoric (e.g., the giving of economic suppon 
to the apanheid government in South Africa while enforcing an 
economic blockade on the democratically elected Sandinista government 
in Nicaragua), but it has gradually initiated an aura of mistrust between 
the citizens of this country and our btethren in the Third World . It 
appears that the Reagan Administration intends to perpetuate the 
current state of bad relations for domestic political gain. By casting the 

people and government of Mexico as corrupt drug smugglers, he has 
done the most damage to US-Mexican relations since Davey Crockett at 
the Alamo. This case clearly shows how much influence an enigmatic 
figure can have on the attitudes of is populace. 'For if we were still being 
governed by a president who at least had an inkling of the real meaning 
of human rights, international democracy and diplomacy, Agent Ned 
Cole would be standing trial right at this very moment 

It will be interesting to see how long those in the federal government 
will wait before they begin baiting student activists. They hope, of 
course, that the entire movement will die out over summer so they can 
go on with business as usual. They are worried, we are sure, that student 
intellectuals will start to make those obvious connections between 
govemment abuses here at home and those extending circumstances 
abroad. They are afraid that their intricate design of "divide and ' 
conquer" is becoming unravelled . They do not want US citizens and 
Mexican citizens conferring on what the roots of cultural estrangement 
are. The Reagan Administration is set on internationally dominating the 
sphere of popular ideology, and will clothe the deception in a black, 
pinstriped suit. 

It is hard not to be aware of the perils of consciousness raising. 
Those protestors at Winnie Mandela Library who believe that Big 
Brother is not watching are mistaken. Those who promote the status 
quo in this country have never slept soundly when their sons and 
daughters were out on the streets questioning the value of blind 
patriotism. If there is one concurrent theme in the analysis of political 
scientists who have studied the post-war era, it is that reactions in the 
United States to so-called "radical movements" have been weB planned 
and severe. Think how tenuous it will be for Hubeno Carrillo Estrada's 
family as they attempt to sue the INS. Then consider how awful it will 
be for the protestors to fight the powerful Board of Regents for a long 
period of time. Finally, contemplate how horrendous it will be for the 
human race if these atrocities continue.

Radical chic? 
Editor: 

In [he past twO weeks , the nonnally 
"laid-back" and comple tely apathetic 
UCSD has utterly astounded its 
students, faculty and the surrounding 
commumty with the unprecedented 
Anti ~Apanheld Movement However, as 
morally repugnant as South AfrIcan 
apartheid, may be , I find i( extremely 
difficult 10 believe that the diverse , 
previously apathetic student population 
we have here should unite , as if by 
magic, [0 protest policies of which most 
of us rarely consider. 

The protests of the 'sixties were 
vehement demonstrations against 

polIcies which were readily understood . 
But when I see thousands of students 
on [he evening news marching at 
UCSD, I am somewhat puzzled by thiS 
surprising tum of events and retain a 
somewhat cymcal perspective 
conceming the students' Sincerity. Had I 
asked many of these people their views 
on apartheid twO months ago. they 
would have first asked for a definition 
and then replied that midtenns were 
impending-period , end of story. 
Today, we witness mass sit- ins and a 
planned , organized full-day boycott of 
classes. 

I sincerely hope that I am wrong, but 
I feel that most ' demonstrators have been 
caught up in the sensationalism and 

media coverage, and boycott classes 
partly due to fond remembrances of 
"high school Senior Ditch Day." A 
professor of mme cancelled class for 
May 7 With the majority conse nt of the 
students. When I heard those happy 
choruses of "Yeah, let's go!", I 
envisioned a cam ivaI-type atmosphere , 
perhaps with a cotton-candy booth, 
cheny snowcones and eager people 
waiting to be seen with Carol LeBeau. I 
am planning to attend with the hopeful 
intent of being thoroughly educated on 
this topiC with which everyone seems to 
show such an overriding "concern ." 

My cynicism lies not with the content 
of the demonstration, but with the 

completely bizarre role-reversal of over 
2,000 students who previOusly ignored 
such issues as the Srudent Center 
Referendum, the bookstore's excessive 
pricing policies, parking problems, 
unfair "surcharges: and fee increases. 
Although occasionany a smaU trickle of 
letters are printed in valiant but trite 
opposition, most unfair policies 
continue without as much as a 
whimper. It is only after the fact that we 
hear a meek AS response feigning 
ignorance of student consensus. Had 
this always been an active campus, I 
would [end to admire and suppan the 
sincerity.

Zionism 
By IWAN A. ELWANNI . 

In the May 2 issue of the Guardia'I , David Gappell , a 
deeply committed Zionist, offered his viewpoint on the 
way the anti-apartheid de~onstration on April 22 was 
conducted, and expressed displeasure because one of 
(he speakers at the rally condemned Zionism. In this 
article, Mr. Gappell strongly established himself as a 
Zionist and at the same time ironicany affirmed his 
position as opposed to the apartheid ideology. This is 
something that aroused my suspicion because Israel 
and South Africa are strategiC aBies. The article was 
misleadingly titled "Zionism and Apartheid," but 
s~rprisingly, Mr. Gappell did not (ouch the subject of 
the strong relationship between Zionism and 
apanheid; instead he used the' opportunity to raise the 
controversy of President Reagan's visit to the Bitburg 
Cemetery rather cleverly, and implied that the 
condemnation of Zionism in an anti-apartheid rally is 
as offensive to je":s as is the visit to Bitburg. I intend 
10 discuss the strong relationship between Zionism 
and apartheid and offer an opposing point of view to 
Mr. GappeU's rhetoric by exposing the clear, deep-
rooted common ground that these two ideologies 
share. I also regard Mr. Gappell's article as nothing but 
a clever political statement to the benefit of Israel [hat 
attempts to divert attention away from the unholy 
alliance between Israel and apanheid. 

The close ties between Zionism and apanheid go 
back as far as 1917 when jam Smuts, the then South 
African prime minister, persuaded the British cabinet 
to pass the 1917 Balfour Declaration which caned for a 
jewish homeland in the land of PaLestine. Afterwards, 
in 1934, direct South African investment in Palestine 
commenced by the establishment of a company caned 
"Africa Israel Investments," which today still retains 
?outh African shareholders, substantial propeny ahd 
construction interests in Israel, and one of Israel's 
largest insurance companies, MIGDAL. 

Today, Israel's labor federation Histadrut owns Koor, 
Israel's Largest industrial conglomerate and the largest 
employer in Israel next to (he Israeli government. This 
corporation controls more than 300 industrial plants. 
commercial, financial and propeny companies that 
consolidate and joint-venture with South Africa to 
build computers and produce military electronics. 
Through another South African subsidiary company 
caned Iskor, steel is cheaply produced to provide half 
of Israel's domestic need (51% of Iskor is owned by 
Koor and 49% by South Africa). South Africa also 
financed a battleship building project for Israel to 
produce warships for South Africa. Finally, South 
Africa's investment in Israel is about SIS million 
annuaDy. Trade in diamonds and military gear runs in 
the billions; these products are the hottest items of 
Israeli-South African commerce. 

On the ideological frontier, Zionism and apartheid 
are both racist ideologies. Whilt; in South Africa 87% 
of the land is reselVed for whites and the remaining 
dry, useless 13% for African "homelands," more than 
90% of the land of Palestine is owned by the Israeli 
government to be leased (0 jews ('xciusiveiy, with the 
balance to be available for private ownership. 
Palestinians who are (he originaL natives of the land 
are barred from occupying this 90% of their own 
homeland, face a brutal Israeli. military occupation in 
the West Bank and are deprived of the most basic 
political rights. This, in addition to the fact that many 
Palestinians were forcibly dislocated from their villages 
in 1948 by notorious Zionist gangs like the Stem and 
Haganah who committed alJ'OCious crimes against the 
Palestinian peopLe (the most famous of which is the 
Deir Yassin massacre in 1948 in which every 
inhabitant of the village of Deir Yassin was massacred 
in cold blood by the Zionists, including women and 
children). 

Although Israel has not created this racially 
discriminatory system on the basis of race separation, 
it has done so on basis o[ religion, Zionist ideology 
and exploitation of the jewish holocaust in WWII. 
After all, Zionism cans for the rerum to the "promised 
land" by aB jews no matter where they come from, 
without the slightest consideration and sympathy for 
the rights of th~ Pa.lestinian natives. ~ for example, a 
jew from Amenca hke Mr. Gappell himself. who lives 
comfortably in (he USA and has American citizenship, 
is entitled to land and political rights in Palestine, 
while a PaLestinian native whose ancestors are buried 
in Palestine is deprived of these rights in his/ her own 
homeland. 

Therefore, Zionism is just as guilty of the same 
accusation directed at apartheid, and thp evidence is 
an eyesore for deeply committed Zionists like Mr. 
GappelL Finally, the strong ties between Israel and 
South Africa can only lead to the conclusion that these 
twO 'countries are stratcgtc allIes because they share a 
common ideology of r.tcism. It is the utmost of 
hypocricy for a Zionist like Mr. Gappell to claim that 
he IS anti -ap . .mhcid as he (lId in hl~ aforementioned

Drunk driving and law 
By KHALED A MASRI 

Drunk driving is indeed a problem, and that is the 
issue that should be addressed. A few days ago a 
friend of mine, Cathy, had a couple of drinks and 
drove pown the highway [0 end up in a serious car 
accident. When Cathy was 21 she was already an 
alcoholic, despite the law (hat prohibited her from 
purchaSing or drinking alcholic beverages. As you 
might have thought, Cathy found herself some very 
easy ways of purchasing beer or any other alcoholic 
beverage (hrough her older, and not much wiser, 
friends. Her passionate drinking turned into a disease 
which led to her imprisonment on charges of drunk 
driving. 

This is somehow a small example of the real full-
scale problem that drinking and driving has gotten to, 
and that the authorities have been trying to handle 
with maximum effiCiency. What the authorities have 
failed to see is that the problem does not reside in a 
cenain age group. People of all ages should be 
forbidden to drink and drive. People of all ages who 
break the law should be punished . But those who 
enjoy alcohol safely and carefully, whether they are 19 
or 90, should not be restricted because a few people 
use alcohol dangerously. Although statistics show that 
34% o[ the yearly 25,000 fatalities from drinking atld 
driving involve young people, it is unfair to use (hose 
statistics to justify stigmatizing an entire age group. By 
this method, the law is refUSing to treat people as 
individuals. In such .a case, we might JUSt as wen 
prohibit people 34 to 36 years old from drinking 
because statistics, ironically, show that this group has 
the highest Incidence of alcoholism. 

The oldest argument probably presented a~ainst the 
drinking age is the one that argues that once a young 
person reaches age 18, he or she is considered old 
enough to be recruited and also to vote. At this age, 
tOO, most of the people leave their parents' home (0 
stan a, career, continue their education and maybe, 
ultimately, have a family and become independent. 
Those people in question are no longer young kids or 
children, no matter what some might like to think, 
because they are either serious students or out in the 
work field, and those people who earn their living 
have certainly the right to enjoy their free time with 
whatever they like, even when it comes to drinking at 
a bar with friends, or in the house to relax. What 
would be the feeling of a person who is denied the 
pleasure of attending a college or company pany 
because he IS under age? To deny those citizens 
certain freedoms after they have been given all the

responsibilities and burdens of adulthood is somehow 
a restriction of the rights and a proof of the 
inconsistency of the law. 

My proposal, which is to drop all (he laws 
concerning drinking age, is in agreement with most 
expens' beliefs that the best way to prevent alcoholism 
is to make young people aware of alcohol use. This will 
deal with the drinking problem in a straightforward 
manner and remove the element of mystery and guilt 
from it. The result will be that young adults will Start 
considering drinking as an activity of conforming to 
social norms. and not an act of rebellion against 
society and the law. In Europe, for example , alcohol 
drinking is a strong form of social get-together and 
drinking doesn't start with the idea of getting drunk, 
but rather a way to enjoy the social selling with the 
others. Clearly enough , Europe, and other parts of the 
world where (he drinking age is not strongly 
emphaSized, do nOl suffer the high alcohol-related 
fataliry rates. This can be easily explained by saying 
that 21 has not been proven by any means to be the 
"maturity" age. Also, the assumption that 18 is a non-
mature age is a vague generalization that is not based 
on any sort of evidence , It should be obvious that 
awareness comes with education and not with age. 
Undoubtedly, each one of us has had an experience 
with older people who are able to commit fatal acts 
because of a lack of understanding and social 
awareness. 

Raising the drinking age might make drugs as 
accessible as the alcoholic beverages, a fact that a lot of 
famihes and police forces are nOl happy about. The 
fact that alcohol is sORlehow classified in the 
forbidden range will lead young people to use those 
drugs instead. Drinking will still occur but it will be 
done secretly, if the drinking age is still in force , 
instead of in controllable situations where adults might 
supelVise. like in a pub or a private home. 

Attacking the drinking problem should start on the 
level of public education where it is necessary (0 
increase the alcohol consumption awareness. Young 
people must be taught how to use alcohol properLy, 
sLarting With comprehensive alcohol education 
programs, not only in schools and corporations, but 
also in the family, where parents should instinctively 
learn how to set a good example for their children. 

Also, offering alternatives to drinking and driving 
could help in reducing accidents, Services like no-
question-asked rides that do not involve parents, fare

Is student apathy changing? Let's 
hope so. Are people really willing 10 
fight for their newfound eth ical stan e? 
Will they risk their clean legal records, 
their perfecdy-starched , bleached -white 
GPA's? Or will the once-proud 
advocators of human rights quietly 
sneak to Central Library because their 
books are "calling" 10 them? People say, 
"I am an integral part of this school" 
(and if you really believe that, etc.), but 
on the same token, if one is an active, 
ethical consumer and ProclOr & Gamble 
have similar investments, will one then

doubtful and highly idealistic notion. 

I believe that some proteslOrs have 
researched this subject in depth, so I 
believe in their demonstration. However, 
the abundandy-tan, bleached-blonde, 
gum-chewing surfer gi rl walking in front 
of me probably knows apanheid policies 
as well as Joe at "Tu ne-Up Masters." To 
prolest apartheid armed with the 
knowledge of its repugnance is 
impressive; to protest because "all of the 
UC system is doi ng it" is stupid, it 
defeats th e purpose, and is generally a 
great waste of time . Perhaps we can 
purge ourselves of this feeling of "finally 
gelling back at the all-powerful Regents" 
il nd can view thiS problem m the 
correct light. With hope, Tuesday's 
information dlssemmallon will help us 
become real pr teslOrs and not dime-
store street perfo rmers.

Editor: 
ThIS letter IS d irected to the apartheid 

proteslOrs. 
Let me first say that your lude 

demonstrallon, dunng the UCSD Open 
House, of canymg a casket from Revelle 
to Th ird College m a slow walkmg 
funeral procession while chanting some 
old Beatles song was cute. There were 
girls in bikinis and sarongs up front , 
followed by a long black casket carried 
on the shoulders of angUished looking 
pallbearers, who m tum were followed 
by a fune ral lrain of students trymg to 
be angry young actlvists . 

Put up your surfboard Bim Set down 
your calculator Amy! Let's be stude()( 
aCllvlSts! 

At first I thought this was another silly 
new wave drama club presentation. 
Then, as the processIOn passed closer, I 
rea lized , "No! This is a new wave 
apartheid club presentation!" 

I claim the apa rtheid protestors are 
becoming elitist in their organ ization. 

Perhaps they think, "I've slept for a 
week and a half outs ide of the HL 
Librilry. I'm bener than the rest of the 
students because I have sa rificed." 

A gi rl came by in the head of the 
p rocession handing out red ribbons and 
a li ttle piece of paper with a mysteriOUS 
message. It said something about my 
station being Third College. I thought 
this might mean they're organizing little 
fo rts on the separate colleges of UCSD 
10 press the protest onward . Hey! Don't 
1 get a choice where to protest? I kinda 
like Revelle College with the nice 
fountain in the plaza and all. 

Anyway, I asked the ribbon-girl who 
the funeral was for, and she snapped 
back, "Who do you think!?" 

Well, I think I would probably be a 
little bitchy after not geuing much sleep 
fo r a 'veek and a half also. 

Personally, I am in earnest support of 
the protest agains t the blatant racism 
propag,l(ed in South Africa, but 1 suggest 
that the core p roteslOrs not become so 
elite that the rest of t he student body 
cannot identify with them.

The Good Guys 
Editor: 

In response 10 Heidi LlIIenberg's leuer 
(5/ 2) and her dissatisfied skii ng 
mates . .. I would not say "the good guys 
have gotten the shaft" by the Guardwn; 
rather, you are expenencing the "grey 
syndrome" of UCSD. Recognition over 
one's brilliant, displayed colors is nearly 
impossible and , at best, ephemeral. 
Similar to the sandblasted paIslies, 
novelty becomes nOlOrious and eaSily 
forgonen. "Every ant for itseir should be 
the motto in this university's 
environment. To beat. one's drum is 
futile and possibly SUicidal , especially 
when existing as any type of 
organization. Is CaIPIRG safe? Where 
has the Democrat Club gone? Will there 
be a new mdlcator available next week? 
Why is KSDT see n more than heard? 
And in your case, intercollegiate 
athletics have never been limelighted 
regardless of participation in Nationals 
let alone outright. conquest of the entire 
d ivision. This is an underground school 
as far as organized student groups and 
activities are concerned. 

As a former identity-less athlete, my 
suggestion to you and your deserving 

teammates is to go into self-advertis ing, 
not to ask recognition recompense , but 
to save your future hides bcfore a 
budget oversight deems you nonexistent. 
I know noc of one team who has 
sidestepped your visibility troubles. 
Worse yet is the lack of support we all 
face not only as full-time students, but 
also as part-time athletes, lobbyists, 
reformers and activists. Until some kind 
of cooperative effort between sports 
teams, social clubs, or political groups is 
forged , ignited and presented, merits 
comparable to yours will continue to 
remain in the background, "greyed ou!." 
The Guardian is not responsible for its 
understaffed and possibly 
underfinanced errons to keep the UCSD 
student body up-to-dare; it merely 
reneets another typical organization 
fighting for irs meager share of funds 
and making due with its limited 
resources. 

If there are any doubts about 
recognition of the prolific and 
tenacious, ask the interconegiate softball 
team before they head to the first round 
of Nationals in Pennsylvania. Previous 
bouts with anonymity include being 
denied access to their Warren Field 
twice this season due to a "scheduling 
connicr" with intramurals. Those 
"dedicated ," one.<fay-a-week 
athlete / students lOok precedence over a 
top-ten, nationally-ranked team during a 
do-or-die homestretch? Yes, of course 
they d id, to the embarrassment of die 
team, sc hool, and dismayi ngly enough 
to the visi ting opponents and scheduled 
umpires. 

Ironically, you may have noticed this 
newspaper's liberal coverage of the 
women's softball team for the paS! 
quarter (i f you keep taDy). There are 
several other athletic teams who merit 
the same exposure as they enter post-
season competition. Using my spare 
time to write a few articles for softban 's 
sake is the least I could do as a retired 
member of laS! year's ballclub. 

In the future , I sincerely hope UCSD 
will ope n Its closet doors for all 
successful and persistent tearns and 
organizations to profess their respective 
laurels. In the meantime, I would like to 
congratulate you and the ski team for a 
fine showing this season and wish the 
best of luck to several other teams on 
their various destinies to conference, 
regional and national championships. 

The "grey syndrome" strikes again . . . .

Existentially mundane 
Editor: 

Becci Benwiu's skepticism about the 
existence of the physical world ("There 
is no Time," April 25) was a refreshing 
change of pace from the mundane 
social and political views usually 
expressed in the Guardian . The reality of 
the world a round us can in no means 
be verified; it appears 10 us indirecdy, 
as sensory input. The conscious self, 
however, perceiving the surrounding 
phenomena, has a concrete reality. 
"Cogito ergo sum" - I think, therefore I 
am. If my existence were illusory, I 
would not be here to perceive it .. . or 
anything else for that matter, 

So, regardless of whether or not the 
physical world exists , the fact remains 
that all of us most certainly do. But 
exacdy who and what are we? And why 
have we been placed in this world of 
phenomena? These are the real topics 
that need to be discussed and they're a 
bit toO esoteric for a rmchair philosophy. 
Maybe it'd be best to leave them to the 
enlightened souls at HulCus who recendy 
printed verses from the Bhagavad-gila. At 
any rate, I hope to read more about these kind 
oj ideas in the Juture .. . college can (some-
times) be thought-provoking.

Students strike, rally 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE & RENEE WENRICK 

T HIRTEEN DAYS AFTER 1,200 students gathered to protest UC investment in South Africa's 
apartheid government, an equal ~umber 
rallied Tuesday in the Revelle Plaza as a 
sign of solidarity for the Free South 
African Coalition that has remained 
camped on the Humanities library 
balcony, where lecturers in Tuesday's 
rally have led nighdy reach-ins. 

Professor Hem Schiller addressed the 
gathering: "Do what you have done 
today. Do what you have been doing in 
the last two weeks. Remember, 
somenmes you may feel there is nothing 
to be gained from this. You may be out 
here thinking this is just an event, 
nobody cares. But people in action 
means that you're not lobotomized: 

Minutes before the rally began, 
marchers canying a banner reading 
"Med Students for OiVestment" marked a 
broadening base of supporters for the 
anti-apartheid movement. Medical 
student Daryl Ellis said, "Although you 
haven't seen the med srudents present 
in many of your rallies, our presence 
here today is a siAn that we are with 
you." 

Also representing the Black Students 
Union , Ellis explained that the BSU has 
delayed taking an active role in the 
movement to wait out the

time when many of the initial organizers 
need a surge of suppon. "The BSU will 
join this movement. You will see our 
presence. II will be felt , It will be heard." 

Professor of histOry and member of 
Faculty Apinst Apartheid Steve Hahn 
said, "You've done most of the hard and 
exhausting work thus Car. But this is not 
simply a student issue. II's an issue thal,

Regents' 
financial report 

Accord ing to a study now under way by the Regents' Office of the Treasurer, as of 
February 28, 1985 the market value of the University's investment portfolio was 
approximately $6 .3 billion , wi th nearly 78% representing retirement assets. This 
figure includes approximately $800 miUion of assets in the Short Term Investment 
Pool. 

The University has investments (common stocks and h9nds) in 35 American 
companies with subsidiaries in South Africa. All but two of these companies (Baker 
Int'1. and Dun & Bradstreet ) have signed the Sullivan Principles. 

On average, the South African operations of the companies owned in the 
University's portfoltos have less than one percent of their IOtal assets In South Afnca. 
These companies represent approximately 40% of the Univers ity's reurement and 
endowment assets, or approxi mately $2.4 billion. 

In 1977, the Board of Regents reViewed a proposal for divestment of the secunties 
of companies with operallons in South Africa. The divestment proposal was defeated . 
At the time, the Board adopted a resolution expressmg the followmg polley on thIS 
Issue: "The Unive rsity reaffirms its commitment 10 continue to recogmze those 
respol15ibihties which result from its panial ownership of American corporations. The 
University's investment policies must strive fundamentally for maximum total 
financial re turn cons istent with prudent prese rvation of capital. Consistent with th is 
objective, it is appropriate tha t the UniverSity. consider its respons ibilities in the 
comext of the social and moral concerns of the Universiry community."

Assembly pushes divestment bills 
Stops $151 million building fund 
By JANE ROSENBERG, Sacramento Correspondent 

A SSEM BLY DEMOCRATS made good on two weeks' worth of threats on May 2 by formally 
recommending that the University of 
California receive no funding for 
construction projects next year. 

Assemblymember Roben Campbell (D-
Richmond) ended speculation that UC's 
budget would suffer from the debate 
over $24 billion of investments in 
companies related to South Africa by 
announcmg that his subcommirtee 
would vote against the entire $151 
million capital outlay fund . 

The action by the Ways and Means 
subcommittee on education means that 
Assembly members negotiating with 
senators on the state budget conferen e 
committee will ask that UC not receive 
any of the funds already allocated by the 
Senate. 

On April 29, the enate sub ommittee 
reviewed the UC's requests and 
approved everything except the 
$100,000 the UC saId It needed for the 
planning of future projects. 

"We had no intention of slOWing the 
budget down over South Africa," said 
en. Walter Stiern (D-Bakersfleld ), chair 

of the Senate subcommittee. "I'm sure it 
(the conference committee) wiU be a 
very interesting sessIOn." 

Democrats, led' by Campbell and 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown , had 
contemplated using Assemblymember 
Tom Bates' dollar-for-dollar divestment 
proposal to win concessions from the 
UC Regents. 

Under the Berkeley representative's 
proposal, UC would have been required 
to divest one dollar from companies 
doing business in South Africa for every

dollar it spent on new construction 
projects. But the Assembly leadership 
changed tactics Wednesday, deciding to 
"zero out" the entire capital outlay 
budget in order 10 buy time 10 negotiate 
with the regents. 

The Legislature must complete its 
work on the budget June 15, a week 
before the regents will formally vote on 
divestment. 

"ThiS keeps the issue open," Bates 
said . "We want to maximize our 
leverage . (By June) we'll be able 10 tell 
what the regents are going to do. If 
we're not happy, there's a possibili ry we 
can puU the entire (capital outlay) 
budget out and put it in a separate bill 
with the dollar for dollar proposal."

attending his committee hearing 
Thursday, that legislators aren't looking 
fOI immediate divestment but for some 
sign the University will divest within the 
next three to six years. 

"I want to point out that no one is 
without guilt. I have a bank account in a 
bank with investments in South Africa. 
We can't solve the world's problems 
with this maU committee but we have 
to start somewhere," Campbell said . 

Last week UC Vice President William 
Baker, reading a statement made by UC 
President David Gardner last week, tried 
to persuade the subcommittee against 
slashing the package.

our common desire to advance the 
cause of social and civil justice in South 
Africa and a course of action ,hat would 
deprive young people of the opponunity

New SA investments prohibited 

T HE FIRST OF THREE divestment bills passed its first legislative test Monday with an amendment 
prohibiting new University of California 
investments in companies with South 
African ties. 

A packed room of anti-apartheid 
demonstrators, including UC Berkeley 
and UC Davis students, sat through four 
hours of test imony before the Assembly 
Public Investments, Finance and 
Bonded Indebtedness Committee 
narrowly approved Assemblymember 
Maxine Waters' proposal. 

The committee voted for the Los 
Angeles Democrat's bill, which prohibits 
new retirement funds from being 
invested in companies which do 
business in South Africa, in a 7-5 vote 
split along party lines. 

Two Democrats- Tom Hannigan of 
Fairfield and Elihu Harris of Oakland-
had to be caUed in from other 
committees for the vote to secure the 
bill's passage. 

Yesterday's vote represents the first 
time in five years Waters has been able 
to get divestment legislation out of a 
committee. 

The bill, known as Assembly Bill 
1134, will next be considered by the 
Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 

Waters' other divestment measure, 
which would establish a five-year plan 
for divesting billions of dollars in state 
employees' and teachers' retirement 
funds, will be considered next year. 

Committee Chairman Richard 
Robinson (D-Garden Grove), made a 
proposal to include 583-86 miilion in 
UC retirement funds in AB 1134 which 
attracted little attention from committee 
members. 

The amendment was immediately 

LOCK-IT LOCKERS 
9550 Keamy Mesa Road 

San Diego. California 92126 
(619) 566-7090 

endorsed by UC Berkeley AS President-
elect Pedro Noguera, who told the 
committee their vote for any divestment 
legislation could help convince the 
regents to vote for complete divestment 
in June. 

"You realize that we're about to 
blackmail you," said divestment 
opponent Eric Seastrand (R-San Luis 
Obispo). 

"We believe it's a pretty clear-cut 
moral issue," Noguera said . "As a moral 
issue, it outweighs any of the financial 
considerations. " 

Regent John Henning, who testified 
for Waters' bill as a representative for 
the California Labor Federation, said he 
does not think the Robinson 
amendment could stick because of the 
University's autonomous stature under 
the state Constitution. 

The divestment supporter also said he 
does not believe the proposal or other 
legislative attempts to win divestment, 
such as the dollar-for-dollar divestment 
proposal restricting the use of 
construction funds, would convince the 
regents. 

"In certain areas, punitive action 
against the University could be 
effective," Henning said. "I wouldn't 
want to see a restriction of funds for 
student education for changing the 
attitude of the regents." 

The initiatives are "counter-
productive" and of "no consequence," 
he said.

studenrs concentrated their lobbying 
efforts on w comminq) swtng~­

have publicly stated they will vote for 
divestment, and the California Slate 
Legislature halted the UC system capital 
outlay building budget, aUowing one 
dollar for funding for each dollar 
divested. 

The Tuesday rally was part of a 
nationwide action. At UCLA, student, 
staff and faculty sat-in at the 
Chancellor's residence and marched on 

t~e Federal Building later that afternoon . 
UC Santa Cruz and Berkeky responded 
to UCSO's call for a one-day boycott as 
part of their fifth Wl'fk of protests. 
Rallies were also held at Amherst , 
University of Florida and Iowa State. 
Across town, San Diego State held its 
second protest.for divestment of state 
funds Wednesday. Student 
representatives from thToughout the 
country part~cipated at a United Nations 
speCIal meeting m New York to discuss 
apartheid in South Africa. 

Many speakers compared the South 
African apartheid government to Hitler's 
Nazi Germany. Give Leeman, born in 
South Africa and educated at the 
University of Swaziland, said, "Last 
Sunday, the Gennan Chancellor and the 
American President 'acrually asked the 
children of some of the people who had 
been hanged, murdered and tonured by 

Hi~r to go with them to protect them 
at Bnburg. One of those children said, 'I 
am not going to be a figleaf over an 
intolerable embarrassment.' Let me teU 
you there is a straight line between 
Bitburg, Germany, and Preto~, South 
Africa:" Professor Ed Reynolds of the 
History Department continued the 
comparison: "Talking about consauctive 
~isengagement (between the United 
States and South Africa) is like IBlking 
about const\llCtive engagement with 

"Hider in 1936: 
Undergraduate bioengineering student 

Russel Andakio, member of the Free 
South Africa Coalition, said, "While the 
United Slates government condemns 
apartheid because of worldwide 
condemnation of apartheid in South 
Africa, they at the same time reap 
profits. So therefore they have coined 
the phrase 'constructive disengagement' 
to misguide the people and to disguise 
the real nature of their actions in South 
Africa." 

One student graphicaUy demonstrated 
his personal divestment frorn South 
Africa by burning his Standard Oil 
Company stock, reminiscent of the draft 
card burnings of the '60s. 

Yareli Arizemendi , political science 
student and coalition member 
announced the activities for the 
afternoon boycott: alternative 
instructions that included "Student 
Movements at UCSD;" a discussion 
conducted by professor of literature 
Melvin Frelicher; and UCSD Alumni

professor of literature Bob Cancel's

CampbeU also indicated that other 
areas of UCs $l.6 billion budget may 
suITer from the increasing prote~s over 
UC investment of retirement funds and 
endowment monies in companies with 
South African ties. His subcommittee 
will be asking Assemblymember Bill 
Leonard's employee compensation 
subcommittee to approve budget 
language preventing the University from 
investing $90 miUion in retirement 
funds in such firms. 

Leonards (R-Redlands) dissented from 
the May 2 vote on the capital outlay 
budget, saying he disagreed with 
Democratic arguments that such action 
wouldn't harm educational opponunities 
at Uc. But he added he could be

convinced to prevent the further 
investment of retirement funds in 
companies doing business in South 
Africa. 

"I'm really open-minded ," he said. 
"That case hasn't been made. But we 
don't have the proper forum to talk 
about twisting the arm of South Africa 
by twisting the arm of the regents." 

Although the subcommittee imediately 
decided to cut the entire capital budget, 
it went ahead with the hearing to 
prepare what it caUed a "B" list of 
funding priorities should some 
agreement be reached on divestment in 
time for the conference committee 
sessions. 

But four UC Irvine projects ran into 
trouble . Assemblymember Richard 
Alatorre CD-Los Angeles) asked the 
subcommittee to delay approval of more 
than $1 miUion in construction fund s 
because of his dissatisfaction with 
campus affirmativf action efforts. 

"They're in trouble ," Alatorre said . "I 
don't think they're committed to 
improving minority representation, 
according to the students and from 
what I have observed. This is the way I 
have to do it to bring attention to it." 

Alatorre, a former UC Irvine 
instructor, reportedly argued with Irvine 
administrators last week over faculty and 
student affirmative action. UC lobbyiSts 
met with him briefly May 2 during the 
floor session and asked Alatorre to meet 
with a UC administrator later. 

For their "B" list, the Assembly 
subcommittee approved for UCSD 
$400,000 for an instruction and 

·research facili~y and $100,000 for the 
Urey HaU air handling system 
improvements. fa 

Investtnents 
( CONTINUED fROM PAGE 8 \" 

The efforts apparently paid off, but 
not so weU with Republicans, such as 
William Baker of Walnut Creek, who 
voted against the bill. The long debate, 
in which over 15 people participated, 
included the showing of the film South 
Africa Belongs to Us, and sometimes 
deteriorated into Assembly members 
drilling witnesses. 

Roos and Papan pressed 
representatives of the California 
Chamber of Commerce , California 
Manufacturers' AsSOCiation, California 
Taxpayers Association and the two 
retirement boards on how the United 
States could stop apartheid if American 
companies believe their presence 

resulted in liberalizing measures. 
"You can then rationalize anything 

you do if you say 'at least we 're there:" 
Roos said when Republicans asserted 
that withdrawal of US funds from South 
Africa would result in a "holocaust." 

"They can be putting people in the 
ovens right now and you could 
rationalize that it's only the Jews and 
not the rest of the German population," 
Roos said. 

In addition to arguing that 
investments in South Africa provide 
jobs, hOUSing programs and educational 
opportunities for South African blacks, 
divestment opponents argued that 
immediate withdrawal of retirement 
monies could raise legal questions and 
pose uncertain fiscal consequences. 

"We can't just bail out of a little piece 
of General MOIors," said Chuck Conrad, 
a representative for the Public 
Employees' Retirement System, 
explaining that US companies often 
only have a small percentage of their 
assets in Soutp Africa. 'We have to bail 
OUt of aU of GM." 

John Harrington, the preSident of the 
Working Assets Money Fund who 
testified at a UC Berkeley forum last 
week, told the committee divestment 
could result in a higher rate of return as 
well as diversifying the state's portfolio. 

Harrington estimated that 42 US 
companies have pulled out of South 
Africa in the laSt five years, an 
assessment Republicans qUickly picked 
up on to argue against divestment. 

Because some of those companies 
were bought out by South African 
entities, divestment would hurt the same 
people the ami-apartheid movement is 
trying to help, they said. 

·Who here today has spoken for the 
working people in South Africa?" 
Seastrand asked. "It is vety elementary 
Economics lA and IB, the way you help 
peopk is through economic investment 
and the creation of jobs. 

"Immediate divestment would create a 
holocaust there . What do you say about 
Chief Cuthelezi (a supposed South 
African foe of divestment), who doesn't 
stand on the Berkeley campus shouting 
into the wind about something which 
has no effect," Seastrand said. 

A state Department of Finance 
representative estimated that the 
divestment bills could cost $31 million 
next fiscal year and $125 miUion in the 
1986-87 fiscal year. 

The department, which usually 
represents the governor's viewpoint, has 
no pOSition on the bills yet.

May I remember 
By CHRISTOPHER CANOLE 

FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE the May 7 Coalition for a Free South Africa rally began, an art student 
shrouded beneath an orange down 
sleeping bag sat like a Buddhist monk 
atop an odd black stain on the inlaid 
brick intersection outside the Revelle 
Commuter Lounge. 

"Ahhh ... Ahhhh .. . Ahhhhh .. . 
AHHHH '" he wreathed in mock tonnem 
while confused bystanders stood frozen 
quivering to his chilling cries. Inside his 
saffron cacoo'n , a microphone 
connected his screams to a reverberator 
and twO loudspeakers, amplifying his 
anguish into the heartS and memories of 
the midday protestors and waking 
sleeping students who peered out their 
donn windows to witness one person's 
statement against oppression. Releasing 
himself from the death bag, the speakers 
continuing to echo like hundreds of 
voices raising on the flames of a 
napalmed village, he said, "Everyone 
screams on the inside. You can see it in 
people's eyes: 

Fifteen years ago May I , as an an 
student, I stood atop Blake HaU 
wrapped in my down jacket 
photographing a cross- hatched log 
sculpture I had just completed on the 
quad below. That night I slept in my 
Beagle Hall bed, until then an apolitical 
conservative UCSD student. 

"Open up. Campus police." Rolling 
out of my bed , I staggered to the pre-
dawn disturbance. "You're under arrest 
for building a bonfire on the Revelle 
Plaza." Trying to focus my thoughts on 
what they were threatening, Govemor 
Reagan's dictate to expeU any student 
caught damaging university property 
while protesting the Vietnam War 
echoed in my mind . They ushered me 
to the Plaza, where four anned guards 
stood at the comers of my sculpture . 
They infonned me that, had ' l lit the 
structure as a participant in the previous 
night's Students for a Democratic Society 
(SDS) candlelight vigil protesting Nixon's 
invasion of Cambodia, I'd be behind 
bars. 

Hell , I believed Nixon's promise to 

disengage American troops from 
Vietnam. As I dismanded my sculpture, I 
worried that my innocent action would 
be recorded as a blemish on my 
university files. Not until nine years 
later, as ( was being screened for a high 
security position, did I discover on that 
day my name was added to President 
Nixon's "Enemies list." 

Three days later, ( watched in 
disbelief as Ohio State National Guard 
troops brutaUy murdered four stUdent 
p rotestors and wounded 11 others. Two 
students, Sandra Lee Scheuer and Bill 
Schroeder, who were not panicipants in 
the rally, were kiUed by the guardsmen's 
random firing across an open field 
behind the protestors. A friend of fatally 
wounded protestor Allison Krause asked, 
"Is this dissent a crime? Is this a reason 
for kining her?" The fourth victim, 
Jeffrey Glenn Miller, lay face down 
bleeding as a fellow student's silent 
scream was recorded in our memories 
forever. 

On May 10 the screams were heard at 
UCSD. 

Nobody saw George Winne walk w 
the brick intersection outside the ReveDe 
Lounge, sit down with his can of 
gasoline, dampen rags, hang a sign over 
his head begging, "In God's name, end 
the war: and ignite himself. Those of us 
inside the lounge heard the horrifying 
sound of a human trying to cry out 
while inhaling flames. 

Winne suffered bums over 95% of his 
body and remained conscious during 
the last ten hours of his life. 

His friends said Winne was not 
involved in any kind of organized 
political activity-he was a "loner type." 
They said he did possess his own very 
deep and sincere moral and political 
views, which included a vehement 
opposition to the war. His closest friend 
dispelled any previous tendencies 
toward suicide, but mentioned that a 
friend of Winne's committed a similar 
act years ago-an act that is considered 
to be the most painful fonn of death. 

One year later in May, as my last 

activity as an undergraduaae at UCSD 
and a fully committed activist, I helped 
in the construction of the George 
Winne Memoriallocared in the 
eucalyptus forest east of Central Ubrary's 
main entrance. A fallen tree's seven 
branches that grew into ~parate 
individual trees symbolically occupy the 
center of the site. The impressiOns of a 
human figure were burned inw terra 
cotta stones laid out as a grave. 
Poisonous eucalyptus leaves we~ swep: 
away and replaced by succulants. Until 
the memory of George Winne beaim to 
fade with each graduating class, [he site 
was used by many for personal 
meditations and reflections. 

One year ago I tried w express my 
own reflections on the anniversary of 
George Winne's death mrough a story 

enlided ~Brackspacing in Time." • 
summarized my ~ and reasons for 
returning w UCSD: ".leeI guiky because 
I didn't do anything in me 'tiOs. People 
were staning w care about the needing 
and bleeding of odters in me world. It 
seemed IiIte everyone was committed to 
something: me war, pollution, civil 
rights, poverty. All I ared about was 
passing classes and getting laid. I didn't 
think I had enough w give, so I kept it

What I did during my summer vacation 
By PWL lAUDER 

5 IXlli WEEK. Again. Sixm week of spring quaner, no less. four more weeks of school, plus finals, equals 
five more weeks before me beauriful but 
somewhat frightening void known as 
summer vacation. 

What will we do with our summer 
vacations? It's time w figure it out. In 
facl, it's probably past time to figure it 
out. Swnrner sneaks up on us; we aD 
love it, bUl we al have w find 

~mething 10 do during mose three 
months, usually something beyond 
lounging on the beach for hours on end. 
since that doesn't pay too well these 
days. 

Figuring out what to do during 
summer is an exciting !aSk to I1105L If 
you're a senior, it's exciting an right-
and scary as hell. This is it. boys and 
girls-this is the rime when the chips 
are down, when the money's on the 
line, when the going gets rough, the 
tough get going-the time to show what 
you're made of, etC., etC., etc. (Throw in 
any other platitudes you know of.) 
When you guys plan £Or the summer, 
you're DOl JUS( planning for the 
summer- you're planning for your 
earur, and your life. The big time. Ooh. 

Yes, seniors, in just a few short weeks' 
you too will be stripped of your security 
blanket (unless you're going to grad 
school). Out into reality you're pushed-
a world of job applications and 
interviews in three-piece suits and 
mortgage and car insurance payments 

I and shopping at stores odter than 
Ralphs and aD sorts of wonderful 

adventures. The real world- $14.95. 
Available at fine retailers near you. 

Maybe I should add a bit of 
clarification, since I myself am a senior 
but plan to be around a bil longer. I was 
just talking about graduating seniors-a 
whole separate group akogether. Some 
of those graduating seniors have held 
omo their security blankets for six and 
seven and eight years-hey, why give 
up a good thing? 

But for us non-graduating seniors and 
aD the reSl of you who aren't graduating, 
SUIlUlIe!' plans are juSl summer plans. 

school just sucks. You deserve a break 
today. So get up and get away. 

Summer school is for those who are 
committed to really getting out of here 
soon. It's also for those with bucks; 
when il comes to fees , the UC is no Mr. 
Nice Guy during the summer. 

Most of us choose option two-or at 
least ~ Iry to choose option two. Get a 
job, you bum. So we go look for a job. 
Grab the want ads: "Laundromat needs 
temporary pan-time help. Minimum 
wage, nights, weekends. No skills 
required. Job involves staring at laundry 

Summe~ school is for those who are committed to 
really getting out of here soon. It's also for those with 
bucks; when it comes to fees, the UC is no Mr. Nice Guy 
during the summer, 
That doesn't mean that making them is 
any easier, though . 

For mosr of us, summer presents 
three basic options: (1) s.0 to school, (2) 
work or (3) travel . Actually, as hinted 
above, there is another option: go to 
beach,. bum around, get nodting done, 
and ignore reality. 

Going w school in the summer 
(option one) is a drag, unless you're 
doing it in Yugoslavia or Bolivia or some 
place exciting like that. But to go from 
nine solid months of school right into 
mree more months of school before 
heading into nine more months of 

revolving in dryers for hours on end, or 
until you throw up. Apply now." 
Binw:>- grab it. 

If you stan looking for employ in 
June-which is tempting when the 
option is to stlrt looking during 
midrerrns and/or finals - then these are 
the kinds of jobs you snatch up, at least 
if you're in it just for lhe bucks. Jobs at 
Carl's Jr. and Fotomat fir the same bill . 
I1l pass, thanks. 

What's sweer is to find a job thaI 
actuaUy has something to do with your 
profession and may aCluaUy have some 
impact on your career and on your 

chances to make that ca reer take off. 
Thar's sweet. That's also tough . (f you've 

~een planning for the summer since last 
September, your chances are pretty 
good. If you haven't-good luck, bud. 

One way to get a job in your field 
and go to school ar the same time is 
through an internship. Internships are 
fantastic-whoever thoughl of them is 
one bright dude, or dudess. For certain 
internships you can get paid , and it just 
doesn't get any better. Coin and credits. 
Such a deal. 

( thought ( was going to go the 
internship route; I wanted one wilh 
some big-shot newspaper like the 
Tnbune or LA Times or one of them. 
Trouble is, I never do these things when 
('m supposed to ("Deadlines?" Were 
there deadlines?"). which is what 
happened again this year. There still are 
a few wriring imemships available, but 
thf;!y're probably with outfits like Joe 's 
Bar and Daily News. 

Option three is to travel. Sounds 
good . Sounds exotic. Sounds like a lot of 
fun . Sounds like a helluva lot of money. 

Ah , someday. 
So, what it all boils down to, then, is 

that there are five more weeks before 
rhe end and I have no idea what in 
God 's name I'm going to be doing. 
That's what this all boils down to. And 
I'm probably not the only one out the re 
in this position . 

What was oprion fou r? Oh hell, I'm 
going to the beach. 1m

T HE WOME . TE IS TEAM has just pushed UCSO mto a national position of athletic 
prominence. In Pennsylvania on 
Monday, the Triton team, seeded 
number two behmd Davidson 
University, went all out and secured 
itself a place in the history books as the 
1985 NCAA Division m ational 
Champions. This wm has just made 
UCSD the UC campus with the most 
championship titles earned this year. 
UCSD, with its two championships in 
women's volleyball and now women's 
tenms. leads Berkeley. which has a 
water polo title. and the mighty UCLA, 
which owns a women's volleyball tIlle. 

UCSD won the team title wuh th ree 
victories during the week. judy Sweet 
commented that this year "the format 
was changed to head-to-head 
competition from a more individual 
player approach. By playing three 
different schools, UCSD showed its 
strength. 

• eedless to say." weet added, ' we 
are vel)' excited and very proud of 
them." 

Coach Liz LaPlante and her team are 
currently in the midst of the 
competition for the national individual 
titles. jessica Vernon, Glenna Moses and 
Nadme Aklmoto are all in the running 
for the national singles title. The # 1 
team of Akimoto &: Vernon and the.it2 
team of Moses &: Lisa Gilbert will 
compete for the doubles title. 

Competition concludes over the 
weekend, and the National 
Championship team will return to San 
Diego on Sunday night. ~

By ROB HASWELL 

A s I SAT AT MY COFFEE TABLE this morning. slightly hungover and definitely tired , I thought 
about my deadline later that afternoon. 
It then occurI'd to me just how many 
stories actually don't pop Into your head 
while you indulge in this practice. Still , I 
sat there. I propped my LA. Times 
spons section up against the napkin 
holder, so I could read the "Morning 
Brleftng." and sat my coffee and cereal 
on m} unopened front page (I'veI)' 
section has us specific job in the 
morning). As the steam from my coffee 
slowly opened my eyes, my mind 
became more and more barren of 
prospective stories. EveI)' interesting 
SlOry seems to have been turned over, 
undressed , seen from the tOp, the 
bottom and disected from all possible 
angles. How in the hell can someone get 
a fresh angle in this busmess? 

As some milk dripped on the front 
page from my spoonful of Captain 
Crunch. an additional disconcerting 
thought popped into my head. I had to 
face the fact tha t by writing for a small, 
bi-weekly college paper. the chances 
that most students will first read about a 
major sports event such as the Hearns-
Hagler fight when they pick up their 
Thursday GuardUln are not real good. 
Bad, in fact. But then my much 100 
potent cup of java started to kick in 
(which, incidentally. is why I always tl)' 
to write in the morning). and my mmd 
began to whirr: I realized that any Stol)' 
can be tackled countless limes, by 
countless wnters, as long as both the 
perspective. and the style ,Ire fresh

trick. One could endlessly flood the 
reader with game-by-game statistics 
about Triton (sub in your 
favorite Triton team), predictions about 
the remainder of the season and 
meaningless anecdotes about a game 
that occurred twO days before 
publication, but the reader probably 
turned to the personals after the first 
paragraph. Interviews. controversial 

reponer, such as myself, does weU to 
read columns like Ostler's and jim 
Murray's religiously. These men are rhe 
embodiment of fresh perspectivt" and 
style. 

The amateur writer, however, does 
well to also be wary of professional 
columns. One often falls into the 
dreaded trap of imitation. "If it works 
for them, it can work for me," is

PERSPECT'IVE 

is a beautiful tool 
comments and player profiles that 
extend beyond the usual vanilla-flavored 
"Joey, a second year Muir student, from 
Oak Park .... " are essential in an 
interesting feature spans article. At a 
small paper such as ours, the readership 
should be addressed as a whole. Water 
polo can be mteresting for the whole 
family. It is simply a matter of 
perspective. 

Style IS married to perspectiVe!. A 
good style can make a writer famous in 
a hurl)' . Ask Scott Ostler. Vel)' ~ew 
people can wme a story about George 
Stembrenner's finng of Yogi Berra and

sometimes the hope. Nothing is further 
from the truth . Sure, short sentences, 
dry prose and mundane dialogue 
worked for Ernest Hemingway, but in 
the 50 some odd years since the height 
of his career, this style hasn't been 
effectively copied by anyone else. Not a 
one! Style is the most personal aspect of 
a writer'S work. It is something that 
evolves through endless reading. and 
then more reading. It evolves through 
the strenuous task of writing amateurish 
article after amateurish article. There are 
no shortcuts. Just as an athle te must put 
in countless hours 10 training hefore he 
or she can become profiCient in his or 
her respectIve port, so stands the 
formula for wrtung. Read, write Jnd read 
some more. It '!, the only way. 

I nOticed a \'Cry unfortunate thtng the 
Other day. One of our own students 
here at UCSD tried ro shortcut Ihl 

system. He was probably slouched in his 
lazy chair at home, struggling for an 
anicle. He was probably unhappy with 
his own style (having read some of his 
'creations," I know why), and decided it 
needed a change. Well. it changed aU 
right. Suddenly his writing took on a 
bright new perspective and was written 
in a fresh style never before in one of 
his anicles. Only one thing stood in the 
way of his certain fame and fortune as a 
sportswriter: It wasn't his own 
perspective or stylel 

I am, of course, talking about Michael 
Greenberg's shameless rip-ofT of an-
article writren by Lowell Cohn of the 
San Francisco Chronicle. While 
ineffectivelr disguising it through the 
addition 0 two brief. but bulky and 
uninteresting, introduclOry paragraphs, 
Greenberg copied a Cohn column word 
for word. I pondered this. Why did he 
do it? ~id he think that by putting his 
name on Lowell Cohn's article it would 
somehow metamorphose into his own? 
For the sake of the admissions 
department here 3t UCSD, I hope not. 
What reason could be great enough that 
Greenberg would effectively torch his 
own integrity in a Single swipe of the 
typewriter key, and in the process 
damage that of his edilOr and the paper 
he wrote for? Sour grapes. I presume. 

As my euphoric, cofTee-induced state 
wore down , I grow weal)' of this tOpiC. 
Mr. Greenberg's days as a writer are 
over-anywhere, and in any capaci ty. 
He lacks the integnty (lost in his own 
itterary suicide), the patience and, most 
of aU, the desire and knowledge of what

Just three great games ... 
By DUNCAN MILLAR 

U CSD'S WOMEN'S WATER polo ream will host the USA Water Polo Collegiate 
Nationals beginning thiS Friday at the 
Canyonview Recreation Center. The 
tournament, which' was won by UC 
Davis a year ago, wiD fearure the top 
eight rollegiate teams in the nation, 
incklding filth-ranked Slippery Rock 
State University from Arkansas. The 
Tritons are seeded third, behind #1 
Stanford and #2 UC Sanlll Barbara. 

UCSD is coming off an 8-5 loss to the 
Hackers water polo club from Long 
Beach this past Sarurday in Santa Ana. 

Although the Tritons "ropped to 7-10 
on the year with the loss, they played a 
solid game against yet another club team 
dominaled by national team members. 
San Diego is 1~ against club reams this 
year, bur is 6-2 in c~giate 
competition. 

Coach Denny Harper called the score 
in the Hackers game a Mgreat score," and 
said that the game instilled even more 
confidence in his team, ron6dence 
which has resulred from playing great 
water polo for the last three weeks. In 
dw time span, San ~ took third 
place at the Scanford Tournament, and 
ibm trounced both lJC Irvine and 
Pomona Pitzer CoIIegc at home. 

~ ua on April 25, freshman 
Miclid CarroU scored six goals and 
junior Jandl ~ three IIIOR to \ead 
the T rirons to a 1 +~ victory. 

On May 1, UCSD raced to an 8·0 
halftime lead against Pomona Pitzer. 
played the bench in the second half, 
and won 12-1. 

These wins. in addition 10 the 
Hackers game, have given the team 
enough confidence to be opt imistic 
about their first-round game agai nst 
UCSB (Saturday at 4 pm) which has 
beaten San Diego three times this year, 
twice by large margins (9-3, 11-4). 

Asked about UC<;B, Harper did not 
seem too worried. "T hey (his team) want 
Santa Barbara badly," he said. 

UCSD lost to the Gauchos in their 
laSt meeting by only 7 -5 ("a game we 
should have won," said the Triton 
coach). Harper feels that if his team 
plays weU in its first [WO games (against 
Irvine and Hayward), then its chances 
against Santa Barbara are good. 

ltIc1uding the Sanlll Barbara game, 
UCSD will need, according to Harper, 
"three great games" in order to win the 
tournament and the national 
championship. Presuming they beat 
UCSB and win their bracket, they will 
have 'to heat the top two teams from the 
other bracket. If this happens, UCSD 
will have its first national tide. Last year, 
they tied for fifth place with Stanford. 

If the weather is good this weekend, 
there should be a decent-sized crowd 
The attendance for home games has 
been sparse'so far this year, but it is 
hoped that other athletic teams and the

A f'ocking wolfpack ' 

He has been called a "directorial 
whiz kid" by his supporters. His 
critics accuse him of having an 
"outlaw image ." But Robert 
Woodruff insists that he does not fit 
either of these labels. If he must be 
categorized, Woodruff prefers to be 
known as a director "just trying to 
survive in the American theater." 
Woodruff seems to be doing a good 
job at that. 

Robert Woodruff: worked with Shepard for five years, directing the premieres of many of 
his plays, including Curse of the 
Stawing Class, True West and Suicide 
in B-f/at. Woodruff staged the 
production of Buried Child in New 
York, which garnered Shepard the 
1979 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. 

Directi~g and surviving 
By JOAN FORSBERG 

Since he began his involvement in 
the theater in 1973, Woodruff has 
worked 'with some of the giants of 
contemporary theater, including 
playwrights Michael Cri.tofer, 
Thomas Ba.be, David Mamet and 
Sam Shepard. Woodruff is currently 
in residence at UCSD, !!erving as 
Regent's Lecturer in the Drama 
Department and directing the UCSD 
production of William Hauptman's 
play ' Heat, which is playing through 
Sunday at the Mandell Weiss 
Center. 

Woodruff's directing has been 
described as imaginative, startling 
and radical. However, the single 
adjec~tve that best reflects his work 
and his personality is enigmatic. 
Even though he undoubtedly has a 
wealth of fascinating stories about 
the leading figures in contemporary 
theater, Woodruff is hesitant to talk 
about his life and his work beyond 
the basic facts of his resume. 

Raised in New York City, 
Woodruff graduated Phi Beta Kappa 
with a degree in Political Science 
from the University of Buffalo. He 
jokillRly calls himself a "brilliant 

scholar." He later completed hi~ MA 
in Theater Arts at San Francisco 
State University. 

Woodruff's initial directorial 
experience was with political street 
theater as an undergraduate in 
Buffalo during the late sixties. 
Woodruff and his fellow students 
staged pageants and demonstrations 
in protest of US involvement in the 
Vietnam War. Woodruff modestly 
claims he was merely a mainstream 
activist. "Our government was 
running a war at this very political 
time," Woodruff says. "And it was 
popular for it (the war) to be 
unpopular. I wu an activist in a time 
when being an activist wasn't being 
very active." 

Woodruff found enjoyment in 
theater because it satisfied his desire 
for immediate gratification. 
"Theater was live and immediate and 
I didn't think you had to know a 
helluva lot to just do it," he says. 
"And I didn't want to spend years 
studying something . . , besides, it 
was something to do in the evening. " 
Woodruff enrolled in night school at 
New Yotl, City College, where he 
decided that doing theater would be 
"an interesting way to spend some 
tl· " me.

New York was not going to be the 
place where he would pursue his 
new, found interest. "New York had 
a lot of other people doing theater, 
and I didn't think they needed me, " 
Woodruff reasoned. He relocated to 
San Francisco, where he co-founded 
the Eureka Theatre in 1973. He 
directed over 15 productions with 
this troupe, including plays by 
Brecht, Pinter, Chekhov , 
Shakespeare and Fuga rd. 

Woodruff believes theater is "an 
exchange of ideas." So he founded 
the Bay Area Playwrights Festival, an 
annual forum for experimentation in 
directing and playwrighting . 
Woodruff invites writers , 
musicians, choreographers , 
performance and visual artists from 
across the country to San Francisco 
to tryout new ideas. The pieces 
emerging from this artistic think, 
tanlc have been developed for such 
alternate performing spaces as 
amphitheaters, football Aelds and 
swimming pools. 

San Francisco proved to be a site 
of good fortune for Woodruff. It 
was at the Mc.gic Theatre in this city 
where Woodruff began his long, 
collaborative relationship with 
playwright Sam Shepard. Woodruff 

Both men have gone on to pursue 
different interests. But Woodruff 
says his work with Shepard has 
inspired him " to find music in 
language and the visceralness in 
response, and to let that determine 
what the theater piece addresses." 

Woodruffs' recent ventures have 
included a hilarious staging of 
Shakespeare's The Comedy of Em"s 
with the acrobatic team, The Flying 
Karamazov Brothers, at the Olympic 
Arts Festival in Los Angeles. His 
adaptation of Adrian Hall's drama, 
In the Belly of the Beast, is receiving 
critical acclaim in its current run at 
the Mark Taper Forum in Los 
Angeles. Woodruff plans to stay in 
La Jolla this summer to direct Bertolt 
Brecht's A Man's A Man for the La 
Jolla Playhouse. 

Unlike ll10st directors, Woodruff 
does not approach his directinl! 
philosophicall y. He does not . 
intellectualize or theorize about his 
work. Instead, he creates 
productiOns instinctively, aiming for 
an audience response in the gut and 
not the mind. Woodruff's current 
staging of William Hauptman's 
intense drama Heat illustrates his 
style.

Presenting theater 
a different side 

By ROBIN scon 
What do such disparate venues as 

Studio 54, the Kitchen, the Walker 
Arts Center, the Mudd Club, the 
American Center in Paris and the 
Institute of Contemporary Arts in 
London have in common? The 
answer is: they have all played host at 
one time or another to the 
extraord inary tale nt of Eric 
Bogosian. 

Bogosian is a combination 
writer/ actor/ mime. Before you 
conjure up any preconceived 
notions as to what these skills are 
likely to produce, rest assured that 
Bogosian's act is completely unique 
to the theater today, in both content 
and execution. 

Bogosian is a solo performer 

It was Funhouse that really broke 
Bogosian into the affectionate circle 
of the leading New York art critics 
and patrons. Until 1983, he had 
received little attention or financial 
support although he had been 
working steadily on a number of 
projects since his arrival in New 
York in 1975. 

"The first couple of years were hit 
or miss," he says. "I got very 
depressed. I had a two-month tour 
that was canceled 30 days before it 
was to begin. I had no work. As late 
as the middle of last summer, 1 was 
so deeply in debt that I was getting 
ready to jump out of the field 
altogether. 

Since Funhouse, which b~n at 

NEOFESTNEOFESTNEOSTNEOFE 
--.. -.. -.. -..---.....~ ........ -............. ---.. -.. -.. -.-.. -.. -.. -............... ~---.. ....... ~~ 

whose act, using s arcely any props, 
ostumes or make-up, is a mimic of 

various personas. His work offers a 
darkly introspective look inside the 
most seedy centers of American 
society. His portrayal of such 
personality types as a street hustler, a 
media evangelist, a life insurance 
salesman and a convicted mass 
murderer, to name a few, produce a 
concentrated vision of the sickness 
that underlies ociety. Bogosian 
reveals what the television reports 
do not. His portraits are stark, 
precise and uncpmpromising. 

The West Coast premiere of his 
new work, Drinking in America will 
be presented as part of Sushi's third 
annual Neofest. Last October, 
Bogosian brought an earlier work, 
Funhouse to the same downtown 
theater. 

Transcendental 

Lower Manhattan's Public Theater 
and then ran for 14 weeks in a small 
off-Broadway house in Greenwich 
Village, Bogosian has published a 
book of scripts and theory (In the 
Dark, Wedge Press), recorded an LP 
of a show last year at the ICA, 
London (on Neutral Records) and is 
currently working with artist Robert 
Longo on the upcoming film Empire. 

As a point of comparison, one 
name that often appears in critical 
reviews of Bogosian's work is that of 
Lenny Bruce. The humor in 
Bogosian's act, however, is certainly 
unintentional. It is more a by-
product of his realism. The 
undercurrent of horror in his act is 
too strong to be ignored. 

Bogosian is not concerned that he 
achieve a uniform reaction. He seeks

"I'm not doing stand-up comedy.

Lies HollyW'ood never 
told Salll Shepard 

By JOAN FORSBERG 
One hundred miles north of San 

Diego, off Interstate 405, is a place 
where dreams are manufactured for 
public consumption. It's an 
insulated world in which power-
hungry executives sit behind 
mahogany desks in plush offices and 
weave the fantasies and the myths 
which determine our existence. 
Images of the good life are placed on 
celluloid tape and endowed with the 
ability to affect the identities and 
actions of those who buy into them. 
Insiders call this dream factory "the 
lndUStry," short for Tinsel Town; 
the City of angels; Hollywood, USA. 

The prolific contemporary 
playwright Sam Shepard has created 
a hilariously funny and bitingly 
satirical picture of this dream 
machine in his play Angel City, which 
is currently being presented by the 
Drama Department in the Warren 
Theater. 

Angel City was first performed at 
San Francisco's Magic Theater in 
1976. Shepard's experiences as a 
Hollywood scriptwriter substantiate 
this indictment of the wheeler-
dealers pulling the monetary strings 
in the mega-bucks movie business. 
Shepard reveals how artistic 
integrity and social conscience are 
swallowed up by the rules of crass 
commercialism. In Shepard's view, 
filmmakers are reduced to robots 
mass-marketing products that will 
appeal to the whims of the public 
mind. 

Shepard tells the story of a 
struggling movie producer who is 
searching for the miraculous 
solution that will save his failing 
production company-a box-office 
smashing disaster epic. Before he 
procures his salvation, the greedy 
producer and his associates meet 

their inescapable fate. 
Shepard has earned the distinction 

of being a leading figure in the 
contemporary American theater 
scene for his work as a playwright, 
director and actor. Famous for his 
explorations of the myths of popular 
culture, Shepard has written over 40 
plays, including True West, The 
Tooth of Crime, Curse of the Starving 
Class and Buried Child, which won a 
Pulitzer Prize in 1979. His work 
resounds With a raw vitality and slick 
theatricality. He admonishes the 
form and content of traditional, 
realistic theater, in favor of creating 
images which play on the audience's 
emotional and psychological state. 

Graduate student Michael Kantor 
is directing the play, which he 
believes is especially pertinent to the 
San Diego area. As an Easterner who 
has been in this region only a short 
time, Kantor feels that much of 
Southern California seems to be a 
suburb of Los Angeles. "When you 
get on Freeway 5 in San Diego, you 
see signs that read: L.A., 100 miles, " 
Kantor says. "And when you go 
down to watch the sunset, you see 
the smog that has drifted down from 
L.A." The Hollywood-manufac-
tured image to which Southern 
Californians most easily fall prey is 
the mystique of fast cars and posh 
homes, stemming from "let's get 
ahead and live the good life" values. 

The potential of the film industry 
to reduce the public mind to wish-
thinking is dangerous according to 
Shepard. Those who get lost in the 
seductive images on the silver screen 
lose contact with all the things which 
make people individuals: books, 
families, religion, art, politicS and 
conversation.

believing that things in their lives are 
different than they really are," 
Kantor says. "Many Americans 
dream about living the life of a movie 
star; a life of drinking, swimming and 
driving to places full of potential ...

their souls in order to achieve this 

power, this eternal life of being on

The UCSD production of Heat is a 

highly innovative exploration of the 
possibilities of movement, setting, 
ligh'ting and sound in a theatrical 
space. Woodruff has created stark, 
disconcerti ng images of the potential 
destructiveness of adolescent 
rebellion, which move in a dream~ 
like fluidity. He has transformed the 
text of this play based on real life 
events into a two-hour nightmarish 
odyssey into the psyche of a young 
man who murders young women 
and buries their bodies in the hills 
outside of Tucson, Arizona. 

Rather than focusing on the 
underlying meaning or message of 
this piece, Woodruff explores the 
play's theatricality. He believes the 
nature of his work asa director is "to 
see everything in a new, fresh way. " 
He does this by providing all the 
voices involved in the production 
with the opportunity to be heard. 

"The writer is a voice in theplay," 
Woodruff says. "He is very loud 
because he wrote all the words. But I 
don't think he has to dominate an 
event. The actors can make their 
contribution very loud, and the 
composer or the sound person can 
be loud. So can the lighting designer,

and the set deSigner and the director. 
Woodruff believes harmony in 

theater is "overrated." He insists all 
the artists involved in the 
production should make their own 
contributions. The director is there 
to maintain the fine line between 
dissonance and chaos. Of course, th.e 
director is also in the position to 
speak the loudest" and th.e strongest. 
Woodruff's belief that the director 
should be the overseer of all the 
action on the; stage is wryly 
illustrated in his placing of himself 
on the stage for a brief moment in his 
production of Heat. He sits hidden 
behind a newspaper, casually, but 
carefully observing everything that 
occurs. 

Big tWaves' are coming 

For Robert Woodruff, what 
started out as something to do in the 
eve ning has evolved into a 
prosperous directing career. He is 
still fatalistic about his work, taking 
one day at a time. " It was a great 
mystery to me how this life was going 
to be lived ," Woodruff says 
referring to his thoughts during his 
undergraduate days in New York. 
"I'm still amazed by what happens 
every day." 

Woodruff has adapted very well 
to the profession into which he fell 
somewhat haphazardly. He tried 
directing because he couldn't act or 
draw. He admits, "I like the control 1 
have being a director." Then he 
laughs, "Besides, it's better than 
selling Kinney's shoes."

(or ". . . Whiskey," depending on 
whether you believe what's on the

-------------------------------------RCCCORNER 
Welcome to another Issue of Rel't:l/atlOns. and RCC Corner. There's 

quite a lot happening about Revelle these days' students are 
embrorled In bitter controversy over everal Issues. regarding both 
our campus and the world m general . eleulons have JUSt ended. the 
pangs of room draw are bemg expenenced. and It looks JS though an 
am-wer to the ultimate broccoli question IS not toO far on the honzon

First and foremost on everyone's mInd IS. of course. the I,>sue of 

Apartheid. RCC will continue 10 support the efforts of the movement. 
so long a Revelle pohcle are ad hered to. Also. the councrl suggests 
Ihat you pay a VI It to the HL plaz ... . read the signs. and talk to the 
people there, If you are even slightly Interested In getting involved in 
the movement or eeking mformatlon aOOut the Issue regarding 

uth Afnca. 
Another Issue of Interest here on campu is the parking SituatIon; 
~tudents are really beglnnmg to see red . m more ways than one. R C, 
In cooperation With other Revelle commmees. conducted a study on 
the usage of Revelle's parking lots. Particular attention was p .. lId to lot 
# 104 (the one hy the mudhuts). The conclUSion W,IS that fa ulty 
usage of the newly-zoned spaces In these lots does not warrant Iheir 
eXistence. tudents submitted their fmdmgs to authorities, and were 
promIsed a re-zonmg (That mean~ we're getting space!> hUlk l)

opting instead to release them to Groundwork Books. K.B. Books, 
and Kinko's to carry the texts or photocopies of required material, 
due to the Bookstore's higher prices. Nor to be outdone, the 
BvokslOre went to the department offices and took the lists. The 
position of the RCC on the e mauers is very simple; while there 
should not be a monopoly for reqUIred reading material on campus, a 
system of selected dispersal should nOl be imposed either. One 
pos Ible olution to the K.B. Books/ UC Bookstore/Groundworks 
dilemma IS for depanments to release booklists to all bookstores in-
the area. tncluding those at UTC and Lajolla Village Square. Perhaps 
then the students' Interests will be served more appropriarely. 

Brreny: 
• For the record , here IS a list of the ~Iy-('lected Revelle officers. 
RCC officer-elects are: Craig Gomberg. Regina Kim.julie Nelkens. lra 
Rubenstein. jennifer Schreiber. and Geoff Toichin, all of whom ran 
unopposed. New AS Reps are Mary Anne Arabia. Deborah Simon. 
and Sal Yeas. A freshman representative wiD be appomted next fail 
• Anyone who applied to RCC for a posjtion on any of the Revelle 
committees should check at the Provost's office (the little glass
