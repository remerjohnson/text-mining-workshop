AS Approves 
A $196,000 
80-81 Budget 

BY JEFF BERESFORD·HOWE 
New. Editor 

The AS tettled on its 1980-81 
budget last night, finally agreeing 
to fund salaries for SCURI and the 
AS Internship Office and to give 
$13,000 for an educational film 
series every Friday night 
sponsored by the Committee for 
World Democracy. 

The Council debated for about 
five hours on the budget; a 
$196,000 piece of legislation 
which carries with it the smallest 
unallocated reserve in the . 
organization's history - $7,200. 

Most council members are 
hoping a petition to raise activity 
fees $4 will get 2,000 signatures 
and thereby justify a fee rise 
without an election. 

The film series will enter its 
second year and run every Friday 
except the day after Thanksgiving.

Late Tallies Give 
Metzger Victory 
Riverside and Imperial 
Counties Are Decisive 

Ku Klux Klan leader Tom Metzger, buoyed by 
returns yesterday from Imperial and Riverside 
counties, took the Democratic Congressional 
nomination in this district that Edward Skagen 
appeared to have wrapped up early yesterday 
morning. 

Democratic officials said yesterday they would 
work to re-elect Republican Clair Burgener rather than 
aid the KKK leader. 

"I won't support him and neither will the Democratic 
Party," said Skagen, who lost by 318 votes. 

"We'll support Burgener," added Skagen, the San

Diego County Democratic chairman. 
State Democratic Chairman Richard O'Neill also • 

criticized Metzger, saying ''he stands for nothing the 
Democratic Party stands for." 

But Metzger, whose campaign message was that 
government should help "white, working people" first, 
predicted he could win without party help. . 
. "The people of the hinterlands, my kind of people, 

really pulled it out for me," said Metzger. "I'm going to 
focus my efforts at reachin~ the white lower· and 
middle-class working people. ' 

Skagen and Solana Beach businessman Bud 
Higgins, who ran third, together piled up 62.8 percent 
of the vote, but they split it evenly enough to give 
Metzger the victory. 

There was substantial confusion yesterday over 
who actually had won the race. The Union and the 
Times, basing their stories on early evening figures, 
showed Metzger ahead. 

This paper, which waited until about 80 percent of 
the vote was counted, named Skagen the winner, as 
did Skagen himself. 

But Skagen's 4,000 vote county margin didn't 
stand up when the small number of voters in the 
district's Imperial and Riverside county sections were 
added. 

Metzger outpolled Skagen by 2,300 votes in 
Imperial and 2,700 votes in Riverside to pull ahead of 
the Julian politico. 

Metzger said Tuesday night he would visit UCSD 
on a campaign stop if asked, and would definitely visit 
the campus if elected in November. Thusfar, no 
candidates forums have been held involving any of the 
candidates on this campus. 

Jarvis Says. He Won't Give Up 
Will 'Stick It Up the Ear' of State Employees 

From the Aasociated Press 
LOS ANGELES - For Howard 

Jarvis, what the voters gave, the 
vot~rs have taken away. But the 76-
year-old taxcutter remained defiant. 

As the returns came in Tuesday 
night showing Proposition 9 - his 
plan to slash state incom tax r8tes in 
half - losing badly everywhere in 
California, reporters who may have 
been expecting the usual awkward, 
conciliatory election-night concession 
speech instead got a dos of vintage 
Jarvis . 

Opponents, he aid , had run a 
"totally dishonest" campaign a 
"goddam con game." And h vow d 
to "shove it up the ears" of publi 
employee union~ , who led th No-on-
9 campaign , with a new initiativ 
cutting their job and pension . 

He aimounced some d tails of that 
proposal yesterday, saying in an 
interview that the initiative, now being 
drafted , would limit pensions future 
public employees to the size of those 
in private industry. A possible second 
initiative would require annual cuts in 
state spending, he said .. 

But the election returns indicated 
the public is far Ie s receptive to 
Jarvis' me sage than the voters who 
passed Proposition 13 -- his 57 
percent, $7 billion property tax cut-
nearly 2-1 in 1978. 

Proposition 9 got only 39 percent 
of the vot and lost by nearly 1.4 
million vot . It was d feated in all 58 
counties . 

And an AP-NB News poll of 
more than 2,000 voters at polling 
places show d that even the 

homeowners , whose banner Jarvis 
carried in 1978, were 58 percent 
against Proposition 9 . 

Clearly, the heralded California tax 
revolt, which was supposed to sweep 
the nation and dominate the state for 
years, has run into a roadblock. But 
it's unclear whether this is the end of 
the road or merely a pause. 

Ralph Flynn of the California 
Teachers Association, one of the 
largest contributors to the well-
financed , smoothly run No-on-9 
campaign, pro laimed "a new era of 
hope ... the· myth has been broken" 
and called the election "the last 
hurrah of an aging d magogue." 

Yet Pro po ition 13 remains on the 
books, more popular than ev r 
according to opinion polls. So doe 
Proposition 4 , a state and 10 al 

government spending limit of last fall 
sponsored by Proposition 13 co-
author Paul Gann, who on Tuesday 
won the Republican nomination for 
US Senate. 

And even the opponent ' strategy 
amounted to a conces ion that the 
publi doesn't regret what it did two 
years ago. 

Instead of letting Jarvis again turn 
the election into a refer ndum on 
government wa te, opponents 
implied that Jarvis him elf was 
turning away from the pirit of 
Propositon 13 with a measure that 
gave more than half its $4 billion-plu 
in annual tax benefits to the wealthi t 
on - ighth of the taxpay r . 

Oppon nt recruited promin nt

UCSD Must Rally 
For Excellence 

BY ANDREW SCHNEIDER 
This campus sits right on the hallmark. We must find a way 

to bond together as a full University or we will be pushed in the 
direction of a highly specialized technical institute . 

. Selected excellence is a term used to say that you don 't need 
one of everything on every campus. It's also a euphemism that 
might fit well to explain budget cuts in the future . Strong science 
departments must be balanced by an equal effort in the liberal 
arts. Frontier scientific research without an exploration of the 
social impact sets a dangerous precedent on the path to a

breakdown in our society . 

We have a responsibility to preserve this place called UCSD. 
1be University presents a hope for the future in a world of 
political tension and economic strain. Only freedom of thought 
can create the ideas to meet the challenges presented to a 
hwnan civilization which considers itself to be in decline. 

It'. a milllOmer to think that ' this in.titution is invincible. 
Many scholars moved We.t when the public education system

bucitet cub are not as severe as expected, but the process of 
cuttinK education become. a legitimate means to face hard 
economic limes. federal funds also slow in the continuing effort 
to balance the budget. Our excellence will be strangled slowly 
by ~bb1int financial retOUrcel. 

Increased need for tuition to make up for the lOll will limit 
accessibility at a time when the student population is making a 
dramatic demographic shift towards the Hispanic community. 
"The Berkeley campus tows the whole UC .ystem into collective 
bar,~ning with its intruding regulations. 

What'l left for research scholars and their students in a 
Univerlity abnosphere buffeted by these constraints? How will 
we respond? I don't know the answers and I won't be afraid to 
say so if we can find a way to count on each other. 

Let's not get tricked into jumping on to the doomsday 
bandwagon. We have excellence at UCSD and we should be 
proud of our effort. Self criticism is vital to a healthy University. 
In the past -.rear we have publicly aired even our smallest 
grievances. Those who criticize have a responsibility to share 
in the work of following through with changes. Are we cynically 
complaining or are we building for the future? 

Rare. is the institution which can disagree to its foundations 
and then carry on. I believe we have a future, but only if we 
work together. A great University isn' t built on consensus. It 
thrives on mutual respect for the exchange of ideas . 

If we are to survive, there must be a renaissance in opening 
the University up to the community. Basic research sometimes 
appears worthless to the public in an immediate benefit sense. It 
takes years to discover the formula which cures a disease or to 
develop a new approach which improves the quality of human 
interaction .

....--------Letters to the Editor --- ------, 

Critics 'Emotional Infant' 
Editor: 

I was reading a copy of the latest Daily 
Guardian while taking a shit in the men's room 
of the Revelle Humanities Library, when I ran 
acroll Charles Bergman's hYlterical protest 
~gainst William Hamilton's recent "Ask The 
Shah" article. 

Up front, I will own up to some bias in this 
controversy - I am an occasional contributor 
to the Daily Guardian and a friend of the 
maligned Mr. Hamilton's. Still, I think I can see 
the larger issue involved in Charles Bergman's 
crazed assault on the "Ask The Shah" feature : 
intolerance. . 

No one - including, I'm certain, William 
Hamilton himself - would make any claims for 
the "good taste" of the "Ask The Shah" piece. 
Its jokes involved scatology, juvenile sexual 
humor and out·and·out shock value to make 
their points . "Ask Th'e Shah" may have been 
funny simply for this reason alone - rather 
than making erudite satirical remarks about 
world leaders, it reduced them to the level of 
grotesque caricatures , deflating their world 
importance, dragging them through the mud 
just to prove they are human beings who 
excrete, grub for money, get horny and so on. 
Or perhaps the feature was pure bad taste -

for argument's sake, let's deal with this for a 
moment. 

Mr. Bergman, there are things far more 
offensive and harmful to society than the 
obscene, the lascivious, the pornographic and 
the shameful. These include the repressive, the 
prudish, the neurotically puritannical, the self· 
righteous. 

Your thoroughly excessive, mean-spirited 
attack upon Hamilton's light-hearted bathroom 
humor exposes (I hope you don't mind me using 
that word) you as worse than a person who 
can't t~e a joke, Your shrill whining about 
"decadence" shows that you are alraid of a few 
naughty words and off·color comments, and 
are willing to crack down on those that use them 
in order to prot~t your supposed purity . 

Mr. Bergman, what if I walked up to you and 
shouted "cockpissjizz" at your sensitive virgin 
ears ? Would you cower in mortal fear? What if 
I then shouted the BIG ONE at you - "Fuck!!" 
- before you could escape? Would you have 
heart failure on the spot? Would you be scarred 
for the rest of your life? I would hope that you 
WOULD be, if you allow "dirty" words and 
ideas to affect you so much. You're obviously 
an emotional infant, so what use would you

· Senate Stalled on 
Peripheral Canal 

SACRAMENTO - A 
last-minute change of heart by 
a Fresno assemblyman stalled 
the Peripheral Canal bill in an 
Assembly committee yester-
day . 

Democratic Assemblyman 
Richard Lehman, whose vote 
had been counted on to get 
SB200 through the Assembly 
Water, Parks and Wildlife 
Committee, said at a noon· 
hour committee session he 
wanted more time . 

The vote was 4-3 in favor of 
the bill by Sen. Ruben Ayala , 
D·Chino, but five votes are 
needed to clear the nine· 
member committee. 

Kapiloff said if he can't get 
Lehman's vote for SB200, he 
might have to reopen 
negotiations with senators to 
accept some of the McCarthy 
amendments. 

Ayala said there is such a 
"fragile coalition" supporting 
SB200 in the Senate that any 
Assembly a.mendment could 
mean defeat. If it can get 
through the Assembly without

public tantrum and shut down the Daily 
Guardian because of its moral debauchery. I'd 
like to see him try - it would be a real pleasure 
for him to confront the AS Communications 
Board and have them deliver a thoroughly 
appropriate, emintently-tasteful-under-the-
circumstances "Fuck You!"

great potential resource for the education of 
UCSD students and the public. 

People with basically reactionary ideas 
haven't had a great deal of luck in UCSD 
elections, so the best way for such types to get 
elected might just be to put on some party hats 
and claim to be apolitical. But after the election, 
watch out. 

Has anyone figured out yet why people of 
non-white races, people from low income 
backgrounds, and people with humanistic 
political concerns do not seem to share the 
passion for silliness?

voters there found. 

More of the defections 
came from Kennedy voters 
than from Carter voters. 

While from two-thirds to 
three-quarters of the Carter 
voters said they would back 
the president in November, 
less than one in five of the 
Kennedy voters said they 
would. 

Republica n prima ry 
voterl in California voted 
overwhelmingly for Reagan 
on. Tuesday. But one out of 
four of the GOP voters said 
they would not vote for 
Reagan in the fall, with 
Anderson getting the bulk of 
those defections, according 
to interviews with 1,930 
Republican primary voters.
