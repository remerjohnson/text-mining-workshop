November 2 is more than an election day, it also 
marks the end of months of multi-media advertising 
by candidates and special·interest group. 

The increasing trend towards massive campaign 
expenditures is actually a two·edged sword. Thesame 
media that is a forum for paid advertising also 
provides an unprecedented diversity and volume of 
opinions and information. 

Voters who look beyond the pages of Time 
Magazine and the Los Angeles T imes can avail 
themselves to a broad spectrum of input, a llowing 
them to vote more rationally t han in the "good old 
days" of toeing the party line and querying the barber 
abou t the cand idates. 

Critics increasingly assail media's impact on 
elections, asserting that voters are mindless sheep 
that will gobble and believe everything they are 
expo ed to. Perhaps these critics are simply 
transposing their own habits onto the re t of the 
populace. 

On the other end of the spectrum lie the politico-
scholar zealots, who demand that tho e who do not 
pend hours poring over their sample ballots and 

studying every nook and cranny of the electoral 
process are "irresponsible members of society." The 
truth, e pecially for educated voters who choose to 
exerci e their elective perogative, lies somewhere 
between these two negative, victimized viewpoints. 

Even viewing television news will give an idea as to 
which proposition or candidate races are surrounded 
by controversy, For the most part, a controversial 
topic or race will carry a greater import than the 
mall. inconsequential i ue. 
These areas, then, are those which warrant the 

most study. A perusal of various publications in a 
library will usually impart enough information to 
allow a rational vote on any topic. 

If there is a particularly controversial vote, or one of 
. pecial interest to a given voter, that voter can seek 
out as much information as s/ he feels nece ary, 

The cry often goes up that elections are in the hand 
of clever, intelligent manipulators who can buy and 
sell the electorate with impunity. This is, to a 
depre~ ing extent, true, but the words 'clever', 
'intelligent' and 'student' surely seem to have a lot in 
common. Vote.

Running Thoughts off base 
Editor: 

Mike Greenberg and Jeff 
Savage are way out in left field 
when they ay that former 
Texas Rangers Minnesota 
Twins, Detroit Tigers, New 
York Yankee, and now 
Oakland A's manager Billy 
Martin is the "best manager in 
baseball." Billy Martin is a 
disgrace to the game of 
baseball. 

The way in which he abuse 

the umpire of the game, cries 
after losses (he has been 
known to do this), and his 
general poor sportsmanship 
are all detrimental to our 
national pastime. Realisti· 
cally, I eriously doubt that he 
is the manager with the 
highest winning percentage in 
baseball, the stati tic that 
would theoretically determine 
the "best manager" in the 
major league. 

He did turn the A's arou nd ' 
la t eason from the previou 
year, but only for the first half 
of the split· eason. During the 
second half, the A's floundered 
and quickly lost in the play· 
offs. They were quite terrible 
this year, al o. 

One mu t look at all a peets 
of the game before proclaiming 
one man the best in his field.

Bottle industry in deceitful campaign 
Editor, 

The opponent of Prop. 11 
have used a slogan in their 
campaign , "It ju t doe n't 
make en e." This tatement 
couldn't have more truth than 
to the consumer when 
shopping at hi neighborhood 
supermarket. There he will 
find vast a sort men ts of soft 
drinks packaged in numerous 
ways; all with one point in 
common: the returnable 
bottles are an average of 40% 
cheaper than non -returnable 
bottles or can .. He will also 
realize the upermarket now 
accepts these returnable 
bott les wtth no mention of 
sanitary problems . (No 
supermarket has yet admitted 
to being unsanitary because of 
returnable bOllles in their 

store,) 
The consumer is then led to 

ask two questions of the 
bottling industry: First, if 
Prop.llpa se ,whywillco ts 
of returnables ri se if 
returnable are already 40% 
cheaper than non·returnables? 
Second, why will there be 
sanitation problems when the 
industry already recycles 
today? 

After a watchful trip to the 
supermarket, the consumer is 

led to the obviou conclusion: 
concern over anitation and 
added cost to the consumer are 
not the true motives behind 
the industrie ' anti·Prop. II 
campaign. 

While their true motives 
remain unknown, it is clear 
the indu ' try is in the midst of a 
deceitful campaign in their 
self·in terest. Consider the 
fact s. Please vote yes on Prop. 
11; help America be all she can.

Pucifk Ne" s Sen ice 
As the November election 

approaches , the question 
uppermost in th minds of 
many political analysts is not 
who will win t he elect ion, but 
rather, "Can an election sti ll 
win voters?" 

The trend toward greater 
elecloral apat hy over the past 
:W years, reaching a low of 38 
percenl of potential voter 
turnout. could be acceleratl>d 
In thiS off·year electIOn, many

made. The article tated 
"Intercollegiate Athletics here 
at UCSD asked for a 
substant ial in crease in 
coaches' salaries this past 
year. According to Athletic 
Director Judy Sweet , they 
needed $144,000. They asked 
for $] 06,000, and incredibly, 
they received only $38,000. 
Thi admini tration i a 
farce." Has the admini tration 
crewed u over once again? I 

. think not. However, I would 
liJ<e to clear' up some of these 
fjict : 

1. This increa e of $106,000 
was 1I0t reque ted in 
Intercollegiate Athletics' 
annual budget la t year. It wa 

brought to the Vice Chancellor 
of Undergraduate Affairs la t 
spring and i under considera· 
tion from the Regi tration Fee 
Advisory Committee now. 

2. The $38,000 Intercolle· 
giate Athlet ics received last 
year i part of t heir permanent 
budget. It i a set amount that 
they receive every year. By 
asking for an increa e of 
$106,000, they would bring 
their budget up to a total of 
$144,000, the des ired amount. 

In other words, In tercolle· 
giate Athletics is not receiving 
any Ie. s then they have had in 
the past . They are requesting 
at thi time that an increase be 
given from the Registration 
Fee for an increase in 
coache ' salaries. The money 
ha been neither denied nor 
granted as of yet. I think it is 
important that these points be 
clarified for students. 

The Vice Chancellor has 
(appropriately) asked that thi s 

matler be studied by the Reg 
Fee Committee and a 
recommendation on the 
subject be submitted . It is the 
Comm i ttee's job to look at 
que t ions such as how 
important is IntercolIegiate 
Athlet ics to studen ts and is it 
worth $144,000 (thaI sum 
would include salarie. only) 

~ hen compared with other 
student services that mu t 
al 0 be funded through Reg 
Fees? 

As a tudent and a Reg Fee 
member who must voteon this 
issue, I would be interested in 
other ciludents ' responses. I 
know how the athletes feel, 
but what about the non-
athletes? Would you be 
interes ted in seeing another 
$98,000- 106,000 go toward 
paying I ntercollegiate coaches 
or do you ee ot her areas of 
tudent service which have 

higher , tudent priorities?

Editor: 
Your Monday issue brought 

with it an attack on Prop. 15 by 
Michael Krupnak . While [ 
support Prop. IS, ] am not 
writing to beat the drum for it , 
but to address some of the 
ridiculous as ertions brought 
up in Mr. Krupnak 's letter. 

First of all , he asserts that' 
violence is a product of our 
fast-paced soc iety and 
intensely pre 'sured lifestyle. 
This may be true, bUI one 
must not forget that the use of 
a handgun in a crime or 
murder is often an outlet for 
this so-ca lled violence. just as 
eating an apple is a way to 
satisfy hunger, to use his 
analogy . Handguns m~y not be 
the cau e of violence, but they 
are .certainly an instrument of 
violence and should not be 
readily available tooneandall. 

AI 0, by Michael' way of 
thinking, he supports Prop. 15 
He clearly state. that no 
criminal i going to ru h oul 
and register his gun. That is 
the point. Prop. 15 insures that 
anyone caught WIth or using 
an unregistered handgun in a 
crime or for whatever reason, 

will be given a mandatory 
prison sentence. 

As for the matter of 
protection, the incidence of a 
robber or thief being stopped 
by an angry ci tizen with a 
handgun is extremely rare. 
Since carrying a concealed 
handgun down the street or a 
loaded handgun in a car is 
illegal, handguns are relegated 
to protect ion in the home. 
Certainly there are more 
effective weapons than a 
handgun to fend off, kill or 
del ain a criminal. How about a 
shotgun? A shotgun doesn't 
require great accuracy,a does 
a handgun, and is probably 
cheaper and easier to obtai n 
than a handgun. 

Mr. Krupnak also states 
that "according to Prop. 15. no 
new guns will be sold in 
California." Prop. 15 states 
that no new handguns will be 
sold . A gun store will. 
however. be able to sell every 
ot her type of gun and every 
type of ammunition, as well as 
pre-owned, registered hand-
guns. Gu ns of all other types 
will continue to be readily 
avai lab le to the entir e 
popu lat ion, rich or poor. While

impossible to get a new 
handgun, it will certainly 
make it much more difficult. 

Furthermore, I would 
certainly like to know where it 
is written that "our fathers 
and gran dfathers were 
assured t hat the ownership of 
handguns would be their right 
forever." 

Finally, and perhaps most 
importantly, is Mr. Krupnak' 
outrageous and offensive 
comparison of Prop. 15 to 
"laws in tigated by Adolf 
Hitler and Fidel Castro." This 
com pari on is so tupid that [ 
do not see how it can be made. 
Both Hitler and Castro were 
dictator, instigating laws

mandate by a free people

safet y, as well as the safety of 
others.

SIJll11s0rc>d by t he League of 
Women Voters Tuesday night 
at the Old Globe Theater in 
San Diego. 

With a week to to before the 
November 2 election. Los 
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 
expressed concern that the 
"California dream I was able 
to enjoy is now beginning 10 
crack," blaming "t he 

acramento crowd" of which 
he said Deukmejian was a 
part. 

"You're part of the 
problem," he told th e 
California Attorney General in 
front of a television audience 
across t he slate. 

Deukmejian countered that 
"the Sacramento crowd, as he 
(Bradley) refers to it. is the 
leadership of his (Bradley's) 
own party. These are all the 
people that have gotten us into 
thi situation." He added that 
Bradley's running mate, Willy 
Brown, was part of the 
"crowd." 

Supporting Reaganomics, 
Deukmejian argued that both 
interest rates and inflation 
have dropped sharply. He 
added that Reagan' s tax. cut 
has put mon y back in the 
workers' pockel. The 
Republican "aid that "the rea l

"t he anti-growt h business 
climate created over the last 
eight yea rs by people in 
Sacramento, " for leaving 
people out of work. Unem·

according to Deukmejian, is

" What we're facing neM' is the 

Wilson Jromise of cutting the

that means colleges . Universities '

community. 
"Financially, it's not in the 

cards (for a mandatory 
program)," Brown said. "I 
would like to see a five-ymr 
voluntary prcgram built up, then 
when you have a hundred 
th ousand people in it, you exceed 
its potential.' 

continued from page 1 
Monica Rotary luncheon la;;t 
week. 

"It's pure speculation of what 
he thinks the tate economy will 
be," Bra.vn said of Wilsoo's 
lX'ediction. "rt's his indictment 
of Reaganomics ." 

In addition to upporting 
more aid to education, Br()l.lJl1 
noted that such aid is necessary 
to improve student performance 
in a time when foreign tudents 
are pushing native Californians 
out of some university prcgrams. 

Estimati~ that forty jE'cent 
of engineering students at UCLA 
are foreigners, Bro.vn said that 
California students are being 
forced to compete with students 
from all over the world. "That' 
not a !::ad thing as long as 
everyone that has the talent has 
the opportunity to advance their 
kills,' he added. "But many 

(California) students are not 
gett ing in. " 

By increasing teachers' salaries 
and the number of graduate 
student fella.vships, as well as 
raising basic educational 
requirements in secondary 
schools, Bra.vn said California 
students wi ll be better equipped 
to compete against foreign 
students for admission to state 
colleges and universities . 

"I support the opportunity of 
California students to get an 
education, and not with these 
art ificially high requirements 
(for admission to college)," 
Bro.vn said. "I say expmd, not 
exclude. " 

Bro.vn praised UC's micro· 
electronic scholarship prcgram, 
which awards stipen ds to 
graduates conducting research in 
that field , along with computer 
research at the Berkeley campus 
and the state investment in 
People Project, which funds 
high-technol®, job training at 
the high school, junior college 

and university levels, as ways to 
improve both education and the 
economy. 

Brown also proposed 
increased funding for the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency, the National Science 
Foundation and the National 
Istitute of Hmlth as ways to free 
money for research and 
scholarships. He also propooed 
increasing taxes but said, "I don't 
think you can ask peoplewhoare 
looingtheir job; for more taxes." 

Brown hinted that tax 
increase; would not be nece>."dIY 
if the economy recovers from 
the current reces ion, adding 
that Reagan's economic pro-
gram is preventing an upturn. 

"The Federal IX'cwam is put 
t<:gether with chcwing gum and 
paper clip> and it's about to fall 
apart," he said. adding that 
Wilson will upport Reagan -

policy, tightening tax loopholes 
and deferring the last portion of 
the Reagan tax cuts. "Some-

either the $750 billion in tax 
cuts. either the $1.5 trillion 
military buildup, or something 
else - or you (the !>tudents) or

Vol. I, No.5 October 28, 1982 

A Weekly Arts and Entertainment Supplement to the UCSD Guardian 

Where have all the concerts g 
When UED had to pass on The Clash because of 
facility difficulties, the cry again went up for a 
solution. What happened with that concert is 
happening here all the time. 

By JOHN Nt:[ 
As you have probably heard, The Clash will not be playing at UCSD 

tonight. Despite the great efforts of the University Events Office, the 
Physical Education Department and UEO's student committees, 
no agreement concerning the reservation of the main Gym 
could be reached in time for the band to make an appear-
ance while it was in Southern california with The Who. 

UEO is restricted to one weeknight per quarter with 
which the Gym may be used for a non-academic 
purpose such as a concert. Until recently, a 
weeknight was defined to be one falling between 
the days of Monday and Thursday. It is this 
confusion over the definition of a weeknight 
that is at the root of the difficulties with The 
Clash. 

At the beginning of the school year, UEO 
started its plans to bring the Clash to the 
campus. The manager of the Clash in-
formed UEO that the band would be able 
to play on October 26. At this time, uro 
also booked Oingo Boingo for Friday, 
October 29. According to a local 
promoter, "the Clash was called by the 
promoters of San Diego's Who show and 
told not to take money out of their 
market by booking the Clash the day 
before their show." The Clash told uro 
that they were absolutely unable to play 
on the 26th, but were available to play on 
October 28th. 

UEO released its hold on the Gym and 
requested use of the faci lity on October 28. 
The P.E. Department denied the application 
saying that the Gym couldn 't be tied up for 
two con ecutive days. The Clash was off for 
the first time. After being told that there was 
no way for them to play on the 28th, the Clash 
asked if they could still play on October 26th. 
once again the request for the 26th went in. This 
time, UEO was told that they had already used their 
one weeknight with Oingo Boingo and could not have 
another. 

After the second denial. the P.E. Department was 
approached by members of the student committees that 
work out of University Events who outlined to the athletic 
department the importance to the students of bringing tht. 
Clash to UCSD. Deliberation continued over allowing the use of the 
gym up until three and a half weeks before the concert at wh ich point 
lynne Peterson, director of UEO was forced to cancel the prospect of 
having the Clash simply because they had run out of time. 

That problems exist in terms of student-oriented facilities is evident. The 
only place on campus where a concert can feasibly be held is in the Gym. 
Mandeville is not a suitable alternative due to its limited seating (800 compared 
to the Gym's 22(0), its restrictions concerning smoking and beverages, and its 
policy not to book rock acts. 

Concerts are an important part of the lives of UCSD's student population. This is 
evident through the amount of success that bands have met when playing here. 
Some may argue that those that attend the conerts are not all tudents but the 
UEO ticket strategy for the Clash was to have been putting them on sale to 
students first with the remainder going to the public. 

The smaller concert has made its way back into music. College are one of the 
most suitable mediums to showca e a' small concert of a few thou and people. 
Along with its present tour with the Who, the Cia h is also having a limited tour of 
their own focusing on colleges. They refused to play anywhere but on campu . 
This may have been the last chance to see the Clash in a smaller, more intimate 
setting. Other concerts that the school has had to pa~ up include Adam Ant and 
the Blasters. 

When asked about the ituation with the Clash, Marc Geiger, a promoter from 
Marc Berman Concerts and a UCSD student replied, "Before I came here, the 
university was only having two shows a year. My first year we had eleven; I can get 
any night that I want at t he fox Theater, but I want to bring good music on campus.

Benjamin's new "Year" 
Noted actor Richard Benjamin has given 
directing a try, and comes up with a hit film. 

8y CLYDENE NEt: 
My Favorite Year is well on its 
way to becoming a hit with 
movie audiences acfO.'iS the 
country. This engaging 
comedy owes much of its 
succes." to the blend ora funny 
story, t<ltented actors and a 
new and gifted director in 
Richard Benjamin. Benjamin 
has done an impressive job 
with this film that marks his 
directorial debut. he is better 
known for is role in front o{the 
cameras as an actor in such 
films as Catch 22. Westworld, 
and Love at first Bite. Recently 
Hiatus writer Clydene Nee 
talked with Benjamin about 
directing. working with Peter 
O'Toole and the state of 
television. 

Hiatus: Why did you want to 

become a director? 
Benjamin : I've always wanted 
to direct. but the acting career 
got started first. I studied acting 
and directing at Northwestern 
University, after I graduated I 
[ouldll t find a job as a director 
It is hard to tell someone I am a 
director: they say, 'Sure, what 
have you done?' It i" impossible 
to get work. 

Hiatus: How did you get the 
job as director f this film? 
Benjamin: I directed a 
television pilot three years ago 
called Where 's Papa, Michael 
Gruskoff, the producer of the 
film, liked what I had done with 
the show and wanted me to 
direct My favorite Year. He told 
Mel Brooks who he wanted, Mel 
said, 'great then get him. ' The 
people at MGM said what has he 

done, so Michael showed him 
what I had done so I was 
considered. You don't consider 
directing, they consider you

Hiatus : What was unique 
about Mark Unn-Baker that 
made you choose him for the 
role of Benjy? 
Benjamin: first of all I knew 
that I wanted an unknown actor 
for the part. The problem was 
where to get someone, and if 
they were young enough for the 
part they might be too 
inexperienced for the role. They 
also might not be able to keep 
up with Peter OToole. I sent the 
script to several agents in New 
York and they all sent back the 
same name Mark Unn-Baker. I 
saw him in a play and thought 

----:--- -

Hiatus: Did you ever know 
anyone like Alan Swann 
(O'Toole's character in the 
film)? 
Benjamin : They are an 
endangered pedes a the fiI m 
tries to bring out. There are not 
many of them lelt . We don't

~ night of 
fun and 
'Harry' 

Annex Gallery will 
show Turner's work 

Sy ROM HU 

Senta Driver has described 
herself as a modern dance 
minimalist. Her experimenta-
tion with the concepts of weight 
and power led her to create 
dances for her company Harry. 
in which women lift and carry 
men much larger than 
themselves. Sometimes the 
performances are accompnied 
only by the thumping of the 
dancer ' feet on the floorboards 
and the clapping of their hands. 
Often dances are presented with 
a double front. intended for 
viewing from two sides. 

Sent.. Driver's group. 'Harry' will perfonn at Mandeville friday. 

" My grandmother from Texas to be shown at the Mandeville 
would visit us in New York Annex Gallery from November 1 
periodically during the time I to November 5. Turner. a 

'was growing up. Once. during a graduate student with a B.A. in 
visit when I was about four or visual arts from UCSD. takes a 
five years old. she called me into wealth of childhood memories 
her bedroom and showed me and witty observations and 
two quilt patterns. She told me records them in her marvelously 
she was going to make a quilt detailed. warm and often 
for me and one for my younger humorous works. 

Driver received her formal 
dance education at Ohio State 
University. where she studied 
the techniques of Merce 
Cunningham. Martha Graham 
and classical ballet. Upon 
graduation in 1967. she joined 
the company of Paul Taylor. 

with whom she danced un~iI 
1973. 

Searching for a way to make 
an original contribution to 
dance. Driver founded Harry in 
1974. Harry gave its first 
performance in ] 975. 

Driver explains that the 
company was named for 
Princess Maude. who became 
the Queen of Norway in 1906. 

8 p.m , Wednesday. in 
Mandevi lie, for this perfor-
mance. this five -member 
company will present five 
dances by Driver: "Four Pair." 
'Missing Persons." "Secret 
Kindnesses." "Claimant" and 
"Sudden Death." 

Ticket s for Harry 's 
appearance at UCSD are $7 for 
general admission. For ticket

visiting relatives. and possibly 
" the motorcycle owned by the 
big boys next door." 

Turner's memory of an early 
visit to New York City is 
especially whimsical. with huge. 
wedge-shaped buldings whose 
widened tops curve out over the 
tiny visitors. Perhaps one factor 

I in the viewers instant empathy with the artist's childhood is 
Turner ' s technique of 
representing herself and her 
sIster In the scenes: the are 
always seen from the back. 
looking into the scene as the 
viewer is. and they are identified 
only by color. Turner herself 
consistently in blue. and her 
sister in red, 

A cartoon like quality is 
evoked through the use of 
bright colors and simple shapes. 
but the attention to detail b 
always evident : for example. the 
material joining the blocks of 
the "Texas Star" quilt is "red 
cotton with the 1939 World 's 
Fair logo. the Trylon and the 
Perisphere. depicted on it in 
white. calligraphic-like lines. 

Turner's paintings are done 
fro m a slightly older 
perspective, The theme of the 
evolving family turns up often. 
especially in depictions of 
family gatherings and 
celebrations. Younger members 
of the family form new family 
groups. older ones leave. and 
outsiders are drawn into the 
family circle. Turner chooses to 
chronicle special occasions. she 
says. because " the relationships 
between these changed and 
changing faces at the dinner 
table. the tensions and personal 
idiosyncrasies of the family 
members. are submerged 
during the formality of the 
gathering together for dinner." 

In the interactions between 
family members. Turner sees a 
co mment on society -
'families change as societies 
change" - especially in the 

~tatus of the woman. who often 
maintains the cohesiveness of 
the family group by 
orchestrating family events, 

ror all its folk art quality. 

I Turner''; work is also innuenced by contemporary 'iourees; the 
inncH'atin usc of collage, the 
nattened image of carloon 
artists c;uch as Chuck Jone.'", 
Though her paintings take their 

I roots from tlte tradilion of

Taking time out for a 'Break' with I 
the pop group Human Switchboard 
Coffee Break! 
Human Switchboard 
ROJ R cassette 

Sy I'll KfL TOOMBS 
Reachout International 

Records - ROIR (pronounced 
"roar") for short - is an 
enterprising New York company 
which has established itself as a 
pioneer in the field of cassette-

.only albums. In contrast to their 
far more common vinyl 
counterparts. cassette albums 
have relative ly low start-up 
costs and a great deal of 
flexibility in terms of length, 
Cassettes have thus become 
recognized as an ideal way to 
showcase full -length perfor-
mances by artists with little 
apparent sales potential. 

Not surprisingly. ROIR has 
concentrated mainly on the 
local talent in its area. such as 
the New York Dolls. the 
Fleshtones and Lydia Lunch's 
Eight Eyed Spy. On occasion. 
though. the label has broadened 
its geographical scope to 
include recording of unusual 
interest. such as the Germs' for-
fanatics-o nly Germicide 
(recorded in 1977 at LA.'s 
lamented Whisky A-Go-Go) and 
now the Human Switchboard's 
Coffee Break! 

It's not hard to understand 
the Northeast Ohio-based 
Switchboards's appeal to New 
York fans and critics: Besides 
being an excellent band. the 
Switchboard has as its leader 
one Bob Pfeifer who. in both his 
singing and hissongwriting. has 
obviously been heavily 
influenced by local landmark 
Lou Reed. In addition. second 
vocalist Myrna Marcarion has a 
few Patti Smith mannerisms. 

A delivery 
from the Beat 
Special Beat Service 
The English Beat 
I. R.S. Records 

By DAVID flLMINGt:R 
This is one classy package. 

The English Beat has always 
been a band that could produce 
the invigorating dance music 
and handsomely crafted 
arrangements at the drop of a 
porkpie hat. On Special Beat 
Service. their third album. they 
have brought this multi -faceted 
attack down to a science. Which 
is not to say that this effort 
sounds predictable - au 
contra ire. mon faire. it's just 
that it can be approached from 
two levels. Unless. of course. 
one can totally ignore the 
artistry and just dance from 
beginning to end, 

This album is dominated by 
~olid. up-tempo numbers 
performed well. wi th an 
extremely poli hed produc-
tion, There is. orry to say, less 
of the man ic in tensi ty 01 theil 
first LP. I Just Can 't SLop ft. but 
also less of the slow reggae 
numbers that don ' t go 
anywhere, What is lell IS a ~ort of 
middiegroulld Beat lacldng 
only In extremes, 

but her style is more clearly her 
own. 

One highlight of Coffee 
Break!. a lively recording. is 
Pfeifer's sweeping ballad "She 
Invites. " The song is a 
compelling tale of an 
adulterous affair. very Reedian 
in its depiction of woman as the 
pursuer ("She invites a man into 
her car") and man as the w:lling. 
if somewhat reluctant. victim. 

Many of the songs here are 
similarly affecting in their 
neurotic looks at modern love. 
with titles like "No Heart." "It's 
Not Fair" and "Who 's lAnding in 
My Hanger?" (which is also the 
title song of the group's fine but 
hard-to-find vinyl album ). In 
marked contrast are Marcarion's 

defiant " I Can Walk Alone." 
another song about adultery 
(" When you put your fingers 
'round my ring / I can tell it 
doesn't mean a thing") but 
much more positive. and 
Pfeifer'S boastful ode to his 
girlfriend. "Book on Looks." 

Coffee Break! is notable for 
an abundance of nervous inten-
sity. especially remarkable 
since it was recorded off a live 
radio broadcast. (The program 
was hosted by an idiot named 
Matt the Cat. whose intrusions 
were mercifully brief.) The 
cassette can be found locally at 
Lou's Records in Encinitas. or I 
ordered directly from ROIR (611 
Broadway Suite 214. NY. NY 
10012; $8 plus. $1.25 postage).

It is not quite Halloween. but you will be seeing some strange 

looking characters in the Gym, The bizarre group pictured above.

Formed in 1971 by Rick Elfman as an avant-garde musical troupe. 
the band was originally called The Mystic Knights of the Oingo 
Boingo. They trimmed the name and the band from a 12 to a 9 piece 
unit and scrapped the theatrics to concentrate on the music, 

The LA, based group has just released its second album. Nothing 
to fear which features the singles " Gray Matter" and " 'nsects and 
Wild Sex", The band 's biggest hit was last year's " Little Girls" on the 
album Only A Lad. They will follow this performance with two sold-
out nights at the Universal Amphitheatre in LA. 

Tickets for tit is evening of infectious rock 'n' roll are $7 75 in 
advance and $8,75 the day of the show. They are available at the 
UCSD Box Office and all Ticketron outlets. So get out and bop 'til 
you dropl 

Also on Friday night there will be a dance in the Muir Cafe. 
featuring Orange County rockers Jo Tokyo, The fe tivities begin at 9 
p.m. More fun than humanly possible.

The place is called Jacumba. 

It is a town - or perhaps a 
clean ng - In the mldd Ie of 
nowhere, located off of 
InterstateS some 70 miles east 
of an Diego, and perhaps 80 
mIles from our La Jolla 
ca mpus . For most of us, 
Jacumba's presence adds no 
significant social value to our 
lives. For a special group 
among US, however, it is a 
treasured haven , a place to 
leave books, worries , and 
perhaps even roommates far 
behind, and far below. UCSD's 
Soaring Club frequent s the 
Jacumba International Airport 
almost every weekend of the 
year, teaching and promoting 
the art of glidinR. 

Craig Talbot IS a certified 
flIght instructor (CFll and the 
senior member of t he group on 
hand t he day [ attend . He and 
several of the students left 
UC 'D In a carpoo l around 7 
am. The trip took them 
through the winds of the 
interstate among t h e 
backcountry's hills and 
valleys of rock before they 
came to the Jacumba offramp 
which they took to get to the 
airstri p. "Jacum ba Airport" 
read the sign, painted 
probably 30 years ago on a 
shabby piece of wood. Airport 
- what airport ? "Air strip" is 
being generous, but it serves 
the purpose. On it are located 
variou airplanes, sai lplanes, 
cars, and RVs, one of which is 
an ancient Dodge monster 
with the faded words "UCSD 
Community Services" painted 
on its side. "[ love this t hing," 
says Talbot as he gets in. After 
five minutes of turning keys, 
pu lling out c hokes, and 
pressi ng ga pedals, the beast 
is chuggi ng down the s trip, 

towing one of the club's three 
satlplanes toward the lower 
end of the lane. Behind him is 
the whIte and orange "22": a 
Sclm iezer 2 22 gliderwith t he 
lieS)) emblem proudly 
painted upon it. ThIS is the 
\ eh ide t hat wi II dn most of I he 
IIlst ruct ional work today . 

Aftcr the tow, Talbot takes 
t he three new students and 
one writer through the pre· 
flight, the procedure for 
inspecting the plane before 
flying it. He goes through his 
work meticulously, explaining 
each detail ofthe process not to 
the group as a whole, but 
rather to each individual, 
imparting his concern for 
safely and res pons ibility to 
each of his lis teners. "We 
ex pect safety, not perfectIOn, 
from every person who flies 
here." 

Soon the pre· f1ight is 
completed on the 22, and a 
club member, after running a 
simi lar check on UCSD's 1126 
(i ngle seater, model 26), 
prepares to take off in that 
vehicle . That's time for 
instruction for the rest of us. 

The glider is pushed into 
position on the runway and 
the tow pilot is signalled . Say 
Talbot, "Our club share this 
field with the the Associated 
Glider Clubs of Southern 
California. Really they're only 
associated with us, but that's 
another matter. They own two 
tow planes and four gliders. 
The pilot we have today is one 
of the best." The procedures 
for connecting t he tow line to 
the sailplane. checking the 
skies for other traffic, and 
finally running t he wing 
(supporting and running with 
the wing until the glider can 
tay horizontal) are a ll 

explained. The tow plane and

Ah, it must be a rehef to pia) 

a team in your 0\','0 divis ion for 
once. The UC D women 's 
volleyball team got some relief 
Friday night in Triton 
Pavilion (also known as the 
Main Gym) when they took on 
local foe Azusa Pacific and 
showed what they were made 
of by thumping the Cougars in 
three straight games. The 
Triton haven 't done a whole 
lot of thumping this year, 
basically because their 
schedule has n't given them an 
opportunity to do so. It's like 
playing on the USC football 
team but finding that you're 
going up against the 4gers, 
Raiders and Rams 'of t he NFL. 
You wouldn ' t have much of a 
chance for voctory (except 
against the Ram s) 0 when the 
Trojan schedule call for a 
game agai nst the Oregon 
Ducks you'd have to feel that 
the Rolaids delivery tru ck 
stopped by. 

Azusa is not a team to sneeze

The #2 ranked York Hunt 
Club came into last Friday's 
AAA game expecting to "walk 
all over" the #8 ranked Reno 
raiders. It is a mystery why 
the Bud Man had ranked the 
now 0·3 Raiders #8, for they 
were completely out·matched 
in this contest. 

Quarterback Scott Bernde 
of the "Club" was off to a low 
start, but, helped out by two 
personal foul ca ll against the 
Raiders, he led his team 
down field to the game's first 
score. York mi ssed the 
conversion, so the score was 6· 
O. On their next possession , 
Berndes connected with Ed 
Novak for a 6O·yard touch· 
dow n pass, putting the Club 
ahead 12·0. The Raiders 
quickly struck back with a 
Mike Hipp-Jim Payne 50·yard 
touchdown pass, as they 
threatened to make a game of 
it. York added another6 points 
before the half and led 18·7. 

The seco nd half wa

Key football match-ups highlight 1M action 
dominated by the York Hunt 
Club as they scored another 21 
points while their stingy 
defense which has allowed 
only seven points in the last

one more TD before ending the

Our Player of the Game is 
Ed Novak of the York Hunt 
Club. 

••• 
Budweiser State University 

came into Saturday's AAgame 
with #1 Teke This Ball and 
Shove It with a "very positive 
and up attitude." Thi s 
attitude prevailed through the 
game as unranked Bud State 
went on to dethrone the boys 
from Teke,21 ·13. in a sl'Jgfest. 

By GREGORY MACRONE 
AND JEFF SCHAPIRO 

It is poss ible that t his is the 
toughesl divi s ion on the 
gridion, com bining many 
playoff ex perienced tea ms 
from previous years. 

Dan Butcher led things off 
for the "Buddies" with a 1· 
yard TD plunge, but Teke 
quickly struck back, tying the 
score at 7·7. BSU threatened to 
score again late in the first half 
only to have Tim Freuden· 
berger intercept in the end 
zone. 

The difference in the second 
half, and in the game, proved 
to be the very aggressive BSU 
defense , which keyed on 
Teke 's option·oriented 
offe n se. Teke became 
flustered as pitches were not 

caught , passes were over· 
thrown, and tempers flared . 

As the game neared end , 
BSU scored twice more via 
Sean O'Connell's touchdown 
reception and 57·yard 
interception return. Teke did 
not give up as they scored 
again to cut the lead to 21 ·13. 
Teke regained the ball and 
closed in on tying the 
ballgame, only to have time 
run out as their final pass 
sailed out of the end zone. 

Our Player of the Game is 
Sean O'Connell of BSU. 

What appeared to be one of 
the too contests of the week 
between #1 Up the End Zone 
and #5 Party Animals turned 

Thursday, October 28, 1982 

out to be a lopsided, penalty~ 
filled, 20·0 win for Up the End 
Zone. 

The officiating seemed to be 
slanted against the Animals, 
as nearly every possession 
ended in their relinquishing 
the ball due to , ome obviously 
poor call. The referees seemed 
unwilling to make ca ll s 
again s t the End Zone, 
overlooking flagrant holding 
and roughing calls. 

The offensive spark for the 
End Zone was Wes Aowasa. 
He caught one TD pass and 
threw another. The few long 
drives that the Animals 
sustained were accomplished 
by the strong arm of QB Scott 
Roelofs and the acrobatic 
receiving of Jay Smith. 

Our Players of the Game are 
the referees. * .... 

A $1000 scholarship will not

By JEFF SAVAGE and MIKE GREENBERG TSSHORTS Staff Writers ft:ING -WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Despite intercollegiate 

at hletiCS haV Ing been forced to take a back seat to academics here 
at UCS D, the teams have found a way to be succes ful. Last year 
the athletic department enjoyed it s best sea on ever; women's 
volleyba ll won the national champion. hip, men's basketball 
made the playoff . and men's water polo fini shed in the top ten in 
the nation. This year the women's volleyball leam appears on 
thei r way to repeating as champions. and men's water polo 
might become t h first UCSD team ever to compete in a DI\ ision 
I :-JCAA post·season tournament. II ad Coach Derek Armstrong 
has done wonders in turning the men's !->occer team completely 
arou nd , and the squad !:oeems to be on t heir way to reaching the 
playoffs. The men's basketball team looks like it will have 
another fine season with Head Coach John Block at the helm. 

At~letlc Director Judy Sweet has done a fine job in building the 
department into a winner despite the lack of fu nds provided by 
t he administration. Just think how well the team wou Id do if the 
admin ist rat ion supported intercollegiate athlet ics.

NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT. The Lo~ Angeles Dodgers 
organization . When the year ended so did Steve Garvcy's 
contract , and the man of iron certainly deserve!> a new onc wit h a 
hefty pay raL e, but the organization has apparently derided 
otherwi se. Peter O'Malley, one of the wealthiest men in bal.;eball, 
doesn't feel that Garvey's past performance merits any kind of 
substantial pay hike. Garvey has pl ayed in over 1 ,000 games in a 
row and is probably the most con istent Dodger in the hi tory of 
the fra nchise. Havi ng been in the organization s ince age even, 
one would a sume that O'Malley would th ink twice before 
letting Garvey go. But wi ll he? Time is running out.

In fact , it wa the same old 

story for I he Tritons: not being 
able to play four consi tent 
quarters of quality water polo. 
rn tead of falling apart near 
the end of the game, UCSD 
crumbled at the out et. Down 
3-0 at the end of the first 
period, and 5-1 at half, the 
Tritons decided toput on their 
bathing suits and play ome 
water polo. The end result was 
a clo ely fought second half 
(six to six), but by then the 
outcome had already been 
decided, and UCSDcameaway 
with a bitter ta te in their 
mouths. 

UCSD took a s hot at USC, but came up short. 10-7. 

KARIN KALK '- A a 
sohpomore blocker, Karin was 
not sure of what she could 
accomplish when she came 
here . Her potential is 
unlimited, but she has become 
the most consistent blocker on 
the team (60 blocks)_ She will 
eventually become a team 
leader. 

Milwaukee Brewer Mana-
ger Harvey Kuenn, hired on an 
"interim" basis on June 2, 
signed a one-year contract to 
manage the Brewers next 
year. He lead his team from 
fifth place in t he American 
League East to within one, 
game of the World Champion-
ship this year. 

"We got off to a low start 
against SC, and it is just hard 
to make up that kind of lead (5-
1) again t a team of the 

Slate Fullerton, winning 8-3. 
Not only is holding a team of 

Fullerton'!, caliber to three 
goal impressive, but the 
Tritons played both games in a 
four hour timespan. "Anytime 
you can go to I,os Angeles and 
play two tough teams on the 
arne day, and come away with 

big win, you have done a good 
job," says the 26 year old 
Triton coach,

In the middle of this conflict 
is the P.E. Dept. Howard Hunt, 
the chairman of the department, 
feels that his first and foremost 
responsibility is "to complete 
the mission that the state pays 
us to do." About the situation at 
hand he observed, "Two days is 
forty percent of our cia stime. 
We can't cancel that much in 
one week." 

Tomorrow when Oingo 
Boingo play in the Gym the 
women's volleyball team 
practice for its upcoming match 
against Cal Northridge in the 
Rec Gym. According to the 
team's coach, Doug Dannevik, 
the surface just isn 't conductive 
to intercollegiate practice. 

"The position of the Athletic 
Dept. is that they must work 
within a very tight budget. The 
volleyball team's budget is only 
$2,500. Dannevik 's proposal 
was that Athletics would be 
more willing to re-schedule 
classes if they got "a piece of 
the action." If you charged a 
dollar per head for something 
hot like the Clash that·s our 
whole budget for four months 
made in one night. " Geiger 
refutes this plan by pointing out 
that the gym receive~ a 
percentage of the gross t ieket 
sale as a rental fee. 

There are now plans for an 
extension to the tuden t center. 
Phase. Three, This would 
alleviate much of the pressure 
for facilities by providing a 
more student-oriented 
auditorium to hold concerts and 

partie~. This plan has IIOt gone 
far beyond the talking stage and 
Will take many years to reali/e. 
Righ I no\\' there ex ht., a 
problem too large to ignore. 
Until Phase Three IS dctudlly 
buill. it looks like students will 
have to go off campus for big

'Gregory's Girl': A small time film 
with big time Scottish charm 

By MIKEL TOOMBS 
You know there's something 

a little bit different about 
Gregory 's Girl when you tind 
out that the 16-year-old Gregory 
actually likes his lO-year-old 
sister. 

Gregory 's Girl, a film made in 
Scotland currently playing at 
the Guild, has elements of 
nostalgic sentimentalism (a la 
American Graffittl), but also a 
knowing appreciation of 
modern teenage values and 
relationships. 

In writer/director Bill 
forsyth's conception, it's the 
females who have the upper 
hand in secondary school 
society. The girls seem aware of 
their advantage and make use of 
it, although not maliciously. 
The boys, represented by 
gangling, goofy Gregory, are 
portrayed as shy and 
bewildered, far more at home 
with numbers - or even 
cooking - than with the 
opposite sex. forsyth 's world is 
delightfully accurate in its 
details, and also pleasantly 
askew in its rosy outlook. 

Into this parallel youth 
universe walks - well, runs, 
actually - Dorothy, who 
proceeds to win Gregory's spot 
on the school soccer team. 
Dorothy (a name not heard 
much nowadays, outside of 
repeats of The Wizard of Ox) 
wins Gregory's heart as well , not 
to mention those of most ofthe 
male student body. (In a 

characteristically nice touch, 
she is enshrined in the boys' 
bathroom as "Our Dorothy. ") 

As Gregory quickly realizes, 
Dorothy is no ordinary girl. but 
an exquisite representation of 
the Modern Woman: athletic, 
self-assured, almost inciden-
tally beautiful. for her part, 
Dorothy is fully cognizant of her 
qualities, although she 
graciously admits she isn't 
perfect - she has a small bruise 
below her knee ... 

Gregory 's Girl, much better 
seen than wri tten about, 
basically details Gregory's 
journey of discovery into the 

wonders of women, who are 
ultimately represented best by 
his maturely wise younger sister 
Madeline. 

Gordon John Sinclair is 
excellent as Gregory, all loose-
limbed charm and surprisingly 
eloquent in a rambling, 
roundabout way. As the girls in 
his life, Allison Forster (as sister 
Madeline) is calmly effective: 
Dee Hepburn (as Dorothy) 
manages nicely in the 
impossible role of an 
unattainable ideal; and Clare 
Grogan (as schoolmate Susan) 
is highly appealing and about as 
cute a Scots lass as you'lI find. 

Author of 'Missing' will 
lecture here tomorrow 

If you have ever wondered 
what it would be like to be 
arrested, taken away and beaten 
for no apparent reason, then the 
Thomas Hauser lecture and film 
Missing th is Friday will interest 
you. Hauser is the author of 
Missing, the highly controver-
sial look at the death of an 
American citizen during the 
Chilean coup of 1973. 

Before the film was releasd, 
the US State Department issued 
a statement saying it oQjected 
to the impression that was 
implied by the film that they 
had any foreknowledge of or 
complicity in the execution of 

Charles Horman and the role 
they had in the Chilean coup of 
1973, Though the book and film 
have received much attention 
by the critics, there has been 
little energy put into refuting 
the charges made by Hauser. 

This program is presented by 
the Associated Students Office 
in conjunction with the 
University Events Office this 
Friday in Mandeville Auditor· 
ium. The lecture will begin at 7 
p.m. and the film will begin 
promptly at 8 p,m. Tickets are 
$1 at the Box Office, which will 
be open the night of the 
performance.
