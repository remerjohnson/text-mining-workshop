Most revealing quote: "I won't take a firm 

stand on something until I'\'e heard both ~ides. or 
however many sides there are." 

Linda Clark heads the lnterslate Five. Neither 
she nor the 'Iate as a whole is trying to convey a 
political image. "We are stressing issues that 
affect all students." The quality of student life as 
well as the quality of student representation are 
her important council priorities. 

As current commissioner of Appointments and 
Evaluations. Clark is dissatisfied with AS ~h()rt· 
sighted ness. According to her. not enough 
groundwork is laid from year to year to achieve 
meaningful goals in student go\wnment. As a 
council member. Clark has \.,orked to establish 
Council job descriptions. as \\ell as to gather 
information on campus committees thJt. despite 
their obscurity. often affec t students.

not a Dave Parker. 

Communications: Tim 
Pickwell - has done an 
outstanding job with the 
Kuala . At last we may have a 
commiss ioner who already 
knows media before they are in 
office. D. Joseph Parker. alias 
Dave Parker is running for 
office again, except in anot her 
capacity. If you want to see 
someone burn $ 100 bills in 
fronl of your face. then vote for 
him . Otherwise. I'ote Pickwell.

Letters to the Editor 

The Big Ballot Decision: UCSD 
Mascot to be Koala or Triton? 
Editor: 

UCSl) is emerging as a 
major university; it is about 
time that we identified 
ou r ~e l ves with a mascut 
comparable to the other UC 
superpowers. There are the 
Bears, the Bruins.and now the 
chance tu have the Koalas. The 
koala is an origi nal mascot ; it' s 
not your typical Ivy League 
ymbol, it has character and 

makes UCSD unique. 
The current Triton carries a 

somewhat depressing conno-
lation. Furthermore, very few 
sLUdents really even know 
what a I riton is, nor are they 
particularly interested. The 
Trllon just doesn 't st ir up 
school spirit. a cOlllll1odity that 
we are sorely lacking.

AS they stated. the matter 
deserves sume thought. 

Their major complaint with 
the current mascot seemed to 
be the facl that they don 't 
know what a triton i . In 
classical mythology, Triton is 
the son of Poseidon. the god of 
the sea, and Amphritril e . He is 
usually depicted as a merman 
carrying a trident and a conch 
shell which serves him as ' a 
trumpet. Later on in 
mythology, the term triton 
was applied to a group of sea 
deities. In short, a triton is a 
sea·god. Having a sea-god as a 
mascot is certainly suita ble for 
UCSD. gwen our proximit y to 
the ocean. It also reflec ts upon 
our heritage as an outgrowth 
of Ihe Scripps In stitute of 
Oceanography. A triton i~ an 
excellent svmbol of our man\' 
aquatic tea'm" and pmgrams :

ha ve bear mascots, the 
majority d o not. Th e 
supporters also poi nt to the 
lack of Triton paraphernalia 
as a symptom of triton apathy. 
A quick trip to Ihe bookstore 
will reveal that there is not a 
lot of Triton goods to be had . 

Finally, The Koala made a 
very broad statement which 
said that this vote represented 
the putential dawning of a new 
age and it s failure would 
"doo m LIS forever to 
mediocrit y," My suggestion 
wou ld be that the new 
administration give some 
publicity a nd energy to an 
admittedly neglected Tritoll 
instead of sweeping away the 
old enl irely. ThIS st rategy 
would work well with the new 
emphaSIS being given to 
intercollegiate alh letics.

Student Uprising Over Pornography o~ Campu$ 
continued from page 3 
image of the star Quarterback. 

Thi example rai es the 
issue of mens ' and womens' 
roles as they are portrayed in 
the media . A famou s 
quarterbac k ha a ve ry 
important and prestigious role 
in the game of foot ball. After 
his footba ll career is over it is 
thought that the player can 
continue to be successful in 
bu iness, finance, advertising, 
announcing, or orne other 
prestigious profession. The 
.football player's prestige lives 
on after his career elapses . The 
woma n's role in football, as 
manife ted in the po ition of 
cheerleader, is at best 
auxiliary. Her job is to be 
looked at and admired for her 
beauty. When her career ends 
as a cheerleader she can go into 
po itions uch as po ing for 
Playboy magazine or being 
featured in " X" rated movies. 
The portrayal of women in 
this way by the posters 
ugge t that the e social 

inequalities are alright and 
even "fun." 

At the bottom of the po ter 
in small type came the 
sponsor's name. The po ter 
claimed that the film was 
spon ored by" RO Entertain · 
menl.·' This film wa ' actually 
sponsored by the Soaring 
CI'lb, The use of a pseudonym 
indicated that the oa ring 
Club, an A funded organiza-

tion, was reluctant to take 
responsibi li ty for the values 
which were commu nicated in 
their po ·ter. In any case, it is 
clear that the movie was 
funded either direct ly by 
money from reg fees, or 
indirectly by the AS through 
money which was made from 
howing previous films which 

exploit women, which were 
s ubsidized by their AS 
allocation. These fi lms are 
popular, and thus are good 
fund raisers. 

The author spoke to some 
people (mos tly men) who 
expre sed their oPPOsition to 
the women who were 
destroying the Soaring Club's 
po ter . One person rai ed the 
question of freedom of 
expre sion, stating that people 
had no right to tear down the 
literature of others. Another 
argued that the movie was all 
in fun, and that ,t'Jdent 
realized it was a lousy movie 
and enjoyed ridiculing it. He 
claimed that the polil ical and 
SOCial messages were made 
illegitimate by t he terrible 
acting and dialogue In the film. 
One argument went that it 
wa alright to show the film 
Sin ce women have the 
opportunity to exploit men in 
the, ame manner. One man 
said that he co uld no t 
understand why a woman 
would object to t he posters at 
all. He cited the fact that the

their campus through 
collective action. UCSD is no 
place for the screening of films 
which exploit women, but this 

practice will cont inue unless 
people join together to 
peacefully protest it. Don 't 
mourn , organize! 

These arguments ignored 
the underlying message 
imbedded in the posters and 
the movie . The posters 
suggested that the role of 
women in our society is to be 
observed by men, and that 
being or looking like a Dalla 
Cowboy i omething which 
should be strived for. They 
al 0 ugge ted that women 
who are older, have smaller 
breasts, or do not conform to a 
sta ndard of beauty devised 
largely by men, are not as 
valuable a' an NFL cheer-
leader. 

Election Apathy High 
Among Commuters 

Of a ll the arguments against 
the tearing down of the posters 
in question, the freedom of 
expression makes the most 
sense. One of the guiding 
principles of our society is the 
free marketplace of ideas, 
where idea s which are 
harmful to society are cured by 
more idea and expression. 
Tearing down objectionable 
posters is, however, an act of 
expression, and one which I 
condone. II is very important 
also to join the others who are 
angry In order to speak with a 
collective voice. At San Diego 
State University. women's 
group successf ully blocked the 
screenI ng of "Deep Throat" on 

continued from page 3 
-a lienation is the election 
practice of ca mpaigning by 
political posters. Everyone has 
seen them, hanging from every 
avai lable balcony next to"The 
Devil in Miss Jones" movie 
posters. cleverly ca tching your 
eye with witty s logans and 
s nappy artwork. The 
candidates seem to feel that 
images are the best motivating 
forces - perhaps that explains 
their absence from the forum. 

What is mo t likely at the 
root of voter apathy on campus 
(of both re idents and 
commuters) is the student 
candidates' campaign prac-
tices and the striking 
resemblence they bear to US 
politi cs in general. The 
American voter is so tired of 
being hustled and lied to by 
either short-sighted, naive and 
ambitious rookie politicians or 
out and out crimina ls, he or 
she is beginning to feel that 
voting is just not worth the 
effort. Politica l double-talk 
and campaign rhetorIC o\'cr 

basic issues that rarely 
improve facilitates voter 
apathy. The average student 
fee ls obligated to excercise his 
const it u tional right to vote. He 
or she just tends to seecam pus 
politics as a microcosm of US 
politics, and is so tired of being 
kicked by the very people they 
have elected that they would 
like to make vot ing as pain less 
and noncommittal as possible. 
Thi ' results in image 
campaigning, the cl iquish ness 
of the polit ically oriented and 
the sha llow and ambiguous 
political rhetoric. -

It seem necessary that both 
parties make a concerted effort 
to improve voter turnout. For 
voters, that means a hardier 
effort to get a t least 
superficially involved. For 
ca mpus politics the task that 
lays ahead is to make itself 
more accessible to a broader 
range of lICS!) student s and to 
disassociate it self frolll the 
negat ive aspects of polit les. On 
the e\'e of t he elect ion , It wou Id 
seem t he ~o{)ner. the belter.

Peace Corps volunteers are 
people pretty much like you. Peo-
ple with commitment and skills who 
have assessed their lives and decided 
they want to be of service to others 
in a troubled world. 

The problems our volunteers 
deal with overseas aren't new. Such 
as the cycle of poverty that traps one 
generation after another because 
they're too busy holding on to get 
ahead. The debilitating effects of 
malnutrition, disease, and inade-
quate shelter. Education and skills 
that are lacking, and the means to 
get them too. 

Your college Iraining qualifies 
you to handle more of the~e prob-
lems than you mIght think. Such a\

lices; designing and building hridgc\

grams; introducing better agricul-
tural techniques; advising small 
businesses and establishing coopera-
tives; or teaching math and science 
at the secondary level. 

The number of jobs to do is 
nearly as great as the number of vol-
unteers who have served since 1961 ; 
Nearly 90,000. More volunteers are 
being chosen now for two-year 
assignments beginning in the next 
3-12 months in Africa, Asia, Latin 
America, and the Pacific. 

Our representatives will be 
pleased to discuss the opportunities 
with yo u.

Education requirements as

"Seniors and juniors get

. 

sophomores get lasl pick -

self-paced, you'd think they

Sabrina wi ll be gO tng to 
UC Berkeley next fa ll . in 
sea rch of greener past ures, 

" UC Berkeley has a good 
clinical Psyc h depa rtment,

requ irement s in ma th and 
the ph ys ical sciences a rc a

a lso a good place to meet

Ma ny Ue )) t udents 
have su pposed that the lack 
of campus act ivities has 
encouraged part of Ihe 
altrition rate. but to 
Sabrina. this is not a factor. 

"I ha\'en't been i Jl\ ol\'ed

LANL Discovers Method SO/Otnon 
of Reaction Containment Refuted 

Researcher at Los Alamo. 
Nationa l Laboratory ha\'e 
developed a technique to study 
high-temperature interactions 
of nuclear fuel materia ls. The 
technique could help in 
designing space elctrical units. 
reactor used in power plants. 
an d nuclear waste repro-
ce si ng facilities . 

The technique has a lready 
been used to select materials 
for nuclear units u. ed in space 
explorat ion. Such unIts are 
incorporated in generators 
which transfer the heat from 
nuclear react ion~ in pluto-
mum fuel into electnClty. 
Nuclear-powered heat sources 
mu!:>t operate continuouslv for 
up to ten years at -fuel 
temperatures above 1300 
degrees (eisius, higher than 
t he melt mg pom t s of copper or 
gold. 

To insure that the 
plutonium i" not released, 
alloys of preclOu", metals 
Indium. plat mum or rhodium 
are u"ed a ... container 
matenab. AI1\" Interaction of 
these claddings \\'Ith the 
plutonium would affect the 
reliabilltv and safet\ of the 
heat sources. ,uch jlroblems

"'Thl" I ... a \en' useful tool. 
In"tead of performlllg man~ 

expensi\'e, time-consuming 
tests of the compatibility. a 
single experiment will define 
Ihe reaction conditions." 

In the technique. radioactive 
compounds, which might form 
if the fuel reacts w ith the 
claddings. are \'aporized at 
temperat ures up to 2500 
degrees Celsiu . The vapor i 
collected on targets which are 
analyzed to determine the 
amounts condensed. Gaseous 
atoms in the vapor are 
simultaneous ly identifIed 
wit h a ma s 'pectromet er. 
The ease with which a 
material \'aporizes IS then 
related to its stability and used 
to det erm i ne the condi t ions 
under which the fuel and 
container materia)'; are 
com pa t i ble. 

The met hod \\'ould also be

heated by s team from 160 to 
170 degrees while a vacuum 
was created. 

The UCSD·Convair method 
of using heat induction to 
retain moisture in the paper is 
a :-; ignificant improvement 
over the previous technique of 
wrapping. freezing. and 
vacuum drying. which left 
paper brittle. Paper needs the 
six percent moisture to 
maintain its flexibility . 

The restoration proce~s, 
which left the newspapers 
a lmost as good as new. was 
completed March 28. Since 
this time. Ozudogru and the 
Convair engineers have been 
working on a report which 
they hope to publish that will 
enable this process to receivc 
international recognition .

SIan W, ill' r~ 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE UEPT. Some earh 'icaSOn 
Ba.o.elHlU T/uutJ(Ir/!I . When will (;eorge blo\\' up) The\'a nkec ... 
arc off to an inauspicious start. Thc Oakland /\ S ha \c a dcccnt 
shot at winning the t\ L West but not if new Manager SIeve Horos 
docsn'l pIa y speed burner Rickey lIender~()n and "Iuggl'r 
Dwayne Murphy. Lymg to Ihe media about injurIe'i IS feeble and 
doghouses arc for last place teams. Doe~ Dodger's Ilrsl b,heman 
Greg Brrx'k have the RCXlkieof the Yc'ar honor in hIS hip pode'l 
already? Are the Texas Rangers for real ? Only if Mets right 
fielder Dan ny Heep i~.lIe·s hitting nearl} .()()O. Walch II c<'p and 
the Rangers fade into oblivion by thc middle of Ma~· . The 
Houston Astros aI2· IO? Sorry Tcxas fans . The 'Stros are right 
on schedu le. Talk about a tough divi;,ion. The American League 
Eastern learns better have a lot of high cnergy sub~tances qored 
away in theIr locker room~. because' they ' re gO! ng to necd t hem III 
the race to the top. Our picks for the t\\O last place fllli~hcr:-. at 
the cnd of the season, Torontoand Cleveland. \\()uld finish In the 
midd le of the pack in any other division. If the AI Ea~t \\ Illller 
doc~n't win the World Sene~ ~omethlllg'~ wrong. Thl'n again. 
they'll be so drained from their own di\ i .... ion race ... 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED UEPT. Whv docs the ~atllJnal 
Ba~kl'tball Ass(x:iation use a 2·1 ~ec()nd sllot dod in:-.tead of 
something more practical lik(' a :W second dock or a 20 :-.(.'conci 
clock? Is there ~oll1ething special about the game thatmakl's~.J 

~econd ... an ideal t imc limit? No. according tC) one top NBA ollicial 
who ;,ays, "Some year~ ago \,hen the :-.IBA ordered the shol 
dock. il look over a vear and a half to make'. but Ihe 
manufaclurcr made a mi;takl'. 'Ne ordl'rl'd a:m second dock but
