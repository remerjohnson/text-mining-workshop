The Housing Dilemma - Part II 
by Hannah Cohen 

A record number of students in the dorms of UCSD 
has caused a crowding problem in the cafeterias of all 
three colleges. 

Since Revelle is the most overcrowded campus, 
holding 32 extra students in triple rooms, its cafeteria is 
feeling the worst of the crowding. During peak lunch 
and dinner hours the wait in line is as long as twenty-
five to thirty minutes . 

According to larry Barrett , the Director of Housing 
an d Food Services, the cafeteria of Muir and Third 
Colleges are as crowded as Revelle desp·i te the fact that 
thei r dorms are holding the capacities they were built 
for. This is explained by the fact that last years figures 
showed that on the average the number of students 
each cafeteria serves only varied 1-2% from the others. 

Thra Decker, the Coordinator of Food Services, 
believes the increa,ed cafeteria crowding is also due to 
the number of students who live off-campus who have 
purchased partial meal tags . Last year there were such 
students and this year there are 71 such students. 

Ms. Decker believes more partial meal tags are being 
purchased because of inflation . She feels that off-
ca mpus students have realized "they cannot afford to 
feed themselves" as inexpensively as the cafeteria can 
because the cafeteria purchases food in such large 
quanities. 

Though the cafeteria prices have been hit by the 
overall 12% national rise in food prices, cafeteria prices 
have not risen as much. For those students with 
housing contracts, the price for both room and board is 
only up $10.00 over last year. This increase reflected 
both the rise in food prices and the 5.5% salary raise 
state employees were given. 

However, door prices for those students who have 
no meal ticket at all have increased 25 % over last year. 
Breakfast went from 95 cents to $1 .25, lunch went from 
$1.20 to $1 .50, Dinner from $1.75 to $2.25 and Steak 
night went from $1.75 to $3.50. 

La~ry Barrett said such price increases were okay 
des pite the phase IV regulations, because the 
cafeterias are exempt from phase IV controls. 

Ms. Decker hopes that despite inflation the sa me 
quality of food will be served this year a last year. But 
the~e will be some major changes in the cafeteria meat 
J:lOlicy. 

Though all food is served at all three cafet rias on an 
"all you can eat basi" this year th serving of bacon, 
ausage and steak, will have to be limit d. In fa t, the 
afeteria is "shopping" for a steak policy. It will b up 

to each ollege to d ide what th ir teak policy will 
b . Whil last year bacon or sausase was served sev n 

days a week, this year it will only be served four days 
per week. . 

Another problem that the cafeterias are 
encountering is that students are eating every meal. 
The $220 for the 19 meal plan and the $211 for the 14 
meal plan are rates computed with a 15% average 
missed meal factor. This factor keeps the overall 
quarter prices lower, but if the current trend continues 
a new formula for assessing board rates will have to be 
used . 

The current rates for partial meal tags are $100 per · 
quarter for dinner only and $67.50 fnr lunch only. This

Get High on Class 
Hang gliding, one of the 

newest and most exciting 
sports, is now being taught 
by a UCSD student. 

Mike Greene, a business 
major at Revelle, operates 
the Seagul Flight School in 
La lolla . He and his 
assistants teach the art of 
flying Rogallo wings each 
week-end. 

Hang gliding is one of 
the fastest growing sports 
thanks to a recent develop-
ments in "wings". Though 
Leonardo da Vinci 
conceived of gliders and 
the Wright brothers flew 
them, until recently there 
were few enthusiasts . 

Few flew because gliders 
were expensive, deli ate 
and hard to transport . But 
in respons to the need for 
a returnable spa e ap ule, 
Dr . Franci s Rogallo 
design d the now famou 
Rogallo wings . Thi new 
design Wi! portable and 
inexp n iv to build. 

One of the lat est 
ngine ring development 

has b n the Seagull III Air-
raft . Design d by Mi hael 

Riggs, a graduate a ro pac 
engineer, it ha low r d 

the airspeed necessary to 
fly and provided increased 
sta bility. 

In the Seagull III almost 
anybody can experience 
the enjoyment of true 
flight, without an engine. 

Greene will teach the 
stude·nts in the Seagull 
Flight School this art every 
weekend. Greene has been 
flying " wings" contin-
uously since Easter and has 
learned, through personal 
exp rience, how to fly 
hang gliders. 

He take hi tudents to 
Cantamar, 30 minutes into 
M xico, to practice on 
large sand dune . H re 
they learn the rudiments of 
tak -off, control and 
landin . Due to th oft,

Co-op Book 
Exchange to Close 

The Co-op Book Exchange announced yesterday that 
it will only be able to remain open until October 5, this 
quarter due to lack of floor space. During this week 
sales will go on as usual , but no new books will be 
accepted into the exchange for ale at this time. 

The Exchange opened last week to provide used 
books for students, faculty and staff at UCSD. In the 
first three days of business alone, they received over 
625 used books. Over 125 books and records were sold 
the first week . 

Due to lack of floor space at UCSD, the Exchange IS 
closing and a Co-op auto parts store will take over the 
room. 

The Book Exchange had been housed in the bottom 
of Blake Hall at Revelle in an 88 square foot room. 
During business hours customer crowded the store 
and spilled out of the doorway. 

When the Book Exchange re-opens at the end of this 
quarter it hopes to have a much larger room from 
which to opelate. The manager of the Co-op, Larry 
Deckel, regrets that the Exchange i moving. He asks 
that those who lISed and appreciated the service of the 
exchange to make their views known . 

Possible locations for the book exchange might b 
the Muir Commons or Urey Hall. In order for pace to 
be allocated, administrators like dean and provosts, 
need to know how the university community feel 
about the exchange. 

This week tudent are ncouraged to ollect mone 
for th ir book that have be n sold. If the book ha 
not yet been sold, the Exchange will tore them for the 
students until the e change r -open thi quart r. 

When th han re-op n it hop to b able to

means that students who buy such meal tags will save 
15% off the'new door prices. 

In order to further keep costs down, the food 
services has instituted a new meal tags system which 
will go into effect within the next 2 to 3 weeks. The new 
meal tags will have a photograph of name bea rer on it. 
It is hoped that by the use of a picture 1.0. t hey will cut 
down on the number of students who give their meal 
tags to others to use, or lie about the loss of them. 

On back of the new meal tags will be magnetic tape 
which a new computerized system will read. In this 
way a card can be easily verified as good or bad in a 
matter of seconds. A terminal will be operated by a 
checker at each cafeteria door. Central processing will 
be done by a computer housed at the centralized 
food service office at Revelle. 

The following is a schedule of when and where 
pictures will be taken for mealtags. You must have your 
picture taken at the campus where you are living and 
according to what letter your last name begins with. 
Off campus students should go to Revelle on their 
appropriate night. 

Oct . 9 A-F Oct. 11 N-S 
Oct. 10 G-M Oct. 12T-Z 

Cameras will be located at Revelle's South dining 
Hall, from 4:30 to 6:30 P.M. In the Muir North Dining 
Room from 5 to 7 P.M . and at Third College Snack Bar 
from 5 to 7 P.M . 

Those who cannot make the above times should go 
to the food service office at Revelle from 11 :30 to 4:30 
by Friday Oct. 12. 

Otherwise they will have to pay a $5 .00 fee, to 
receive a meal tag. This is also the new price for 
replacement of a meal tag. 

If a student loses a meal tag and the central food 
office is closed, he/she should go to the appropriate 
Resident Deans office. Each office has temporary meal 
tags which are good for one meal only, since they must 
be turned in at the door.

It has almost been one year since I arrived in the 
practical, affluent town of Hanover, New Hampshire as 
a participant in the Muir-Dartmouth College Exchange 
program. The countryside, as usual, was breathtaking. 
The previous week had known nothing but snow 
flurries, and the earth was uniformly covered with 
white. 

It was Christmas time, and the warmth the New 
Englanders traditionally reserve for this holiday 
permeated the stores while the college, situated north 
of the town, remained silent and serene, abject and 
rather proud throughout the gaiety. I first knew 
Dartmouth when it is most hollow. . 

The students returned New Year's Day. Car after car 
unloaded skis and snow gear, books and stereos . Not a 
bad haul, I thought. The fraternities quickly established 
tradition by blaring racaus music from noon until 
noon. 

I watched the Rose Bowl between sneaking glances 
at the small crowd huddled around the television. The 
atmosphere was so much like home that I was sick. I 
called my parents. 

Financial Assistance 
Available 

That was the first day spent among the students at 
Dartmouth. I was to know many of them as intimate 
friends before I returned to California in September. I 
would like to write about them; Dexter, the computer 
jock; Bill, the poet who quit school to join a circus; 
Breen, the philosopher who stumbled into my room 
late one night and proceeded to vomit his beer-all over 
t he floor . 

I would like to tell everyone about Bartlett Tower, a 
stone edifice with a perch where one can gaze toward 
the hills of Vermont or the meadows of New 
Hampshire; of Sandborn House, the writers paradise; 
of the creaking, musty walls in Wildera and Steele, the 
physics and chemistry buildings respectively; and of ice 
hocky, a mad, crushingly wild game that deserves to be 
banned along with boxing, roller derby, and murder. 

The California State

I am sure that I will mention Dartmouth College 
again in this column. It is an experience that I will 
treasure and will want to share for a long time. 

Since this is the first article under the heading "After 
Midnight", a few words of Introduction are in order. 

People ask why I choose to write for a newspaper. (It 
appears frivolous.) Certainly the five dollar week salary' 
is not a proper incentive. Instead, there is a compulsion 
to write and to express one's ego for all to see. It is an 
action that is derived from a love of construction and 
craft. "Does this word fit? How can I be more precise? 
Do I make my readers think or blink?" Often the 
spectre of peer laughter makes one cautious, but 
usually the idea wins even though pride suffers. 

The title "After Midnight" I candidly admit to 
stealing from a song made popular a few years ago 
which has the line, "After midnight we're gonna let it 
all hang out ." It's catchy and suggestive. However, that 
is not why I selected it to represent my column . I chose 
this title because I confess to a love of beauty, and at no 
other period is the world so serene, so fresh , as when it 
is neither late nor early . 

It is now when the mind wanders and dwells on 
images that have no place in the bright daylight . We 
allow ourselves dialogues with mirrors, moments of 
speculation and reverie. Cool and clean we are, when 
shrouded by night. Our bodies stretch and collapse, we 
gaze directly at the moon, full-eyed, and do not even 
try to count the sta rs . Secret sounds and whistles make 
us ask, "Will I perish? Will I remain?" But it is only the 
loveliness and stillness that robs us of self imposed 
solitude and it scarcely corrupts our innocence when 
the night answers : you remain . 

It is after midnight when knowledge for knowledge'S 
sake is no longer a tedious and old concept, and the 
world is not quite so dumb and hopeless . Emotions are 
taken off the ice and thawed for review, affairs are 
deformalized and patience removed. The profession of 
poetry is redeemed. A quick glance into the stoves 
chrome finge confirms: the mascara is smudged and 
there is a deep, dark crescent under each eye. Hair is 
tousled and the palete is still thick from evenings meal. 
I am ugly and the night is beautiful. It is time to create 
and to think . 

So there is your clue. This columnist does not care 
about cafeteria food and overcrowded dorms. The 
changes in personnel and the passing issues which 
constitute so much of the news reporting system is not 
the sort of material with which I choose to deal. You

and skills together so that 
trips can be formed . 

The first meeting of the 
group will be tomorrow 
night at 8 p.m. in the 
conference room of the 
new PE building. It is 
important as a measure of 
interest at UCSD and a 
factor in determining if we 
get any bucks toward 
buying equipment from 
the recreation fund . Also, 
those attending will make 
the decisions such as how 
we will structure this group 
and what kind of trips we

People Are Different 
By John Dark 

Nudists 

(Some impressions on first visiting a nudist beach on 
the coast of Jugoslavia) 

As a newcomer to such things - a neophyte - I 
want to write down my reactions now, while they are 
still relatively clear in my mind, before they blur into 
the general background of human experience. 

I took a guidebook and a towel down to the rocks by 
the shore, and - at first somewhat self-consciously -
started looking at the bodies around me - first 
covertly, then more openly as I noted that nobody 
seemed to care, anyway. And these are notes on my 
observations. 

First, then - within seconds or minutes of arriving at 
the stretch of beach set aside for nudists - I became 
vividly aware that people can be dist inguished into two 
sexes on the basis of certain physical features . The 
mature or maturing women have breasts, the men have 
penis. I knew this before, of course, but my knowledge 
was mostly derived from inference and extrapolation , 
si nce I'd seen few such organis before in the flesh -
much fewer than , say, faces or hands . 

I noticed at once that these features varied 
considerably from one individual to another. Some 
women, like some girls, have less well-developed 
breasts ; those of others are bigger and more rounded; 
and the bigger they are, generally, the more they tend 
to nang down. (A natural law, this, though it is 
sometimes concealed by the engineering arts of the 
underwear manufacturers.) 

O lder women have flatter breasts, which may be 
wrinkled with age. Nipples are more or less promin ent, 
and the surrounding areas may be raised and more or 
less darkly pigmented - though in some women they 
are only as pink as the rest of the breasts. 

Penis, too, vary considerably in size and shape. Some 
have been circumcised, some not : some seem to end 
in little points, while others are almost club-shaped.

While most people were 

enjoying the summer 
months the United 
Farmworker' s Union was 
engaged in the worst strug-
gle it has experienced since 
its inception . A triple 
alliance of Teamsters , 
Growers and Grocery 
Chain com panies were 
chopping away at the base 
of the Union, the grape 
contracts of 1970. The unity 
of these three factions has 
created a situation of triple 
oppression for the United 
Farmworker 's Union 
(UFW); within this context 
no one person or organi-
zation can be considered 
an innocent part . 

The oppression that was 
seen in the fields this 
summer was of unbelie-
vable proportions, 
beginning the hired goons, 
to vigilante squads and 
even extending to the 
out right killing of UFW 
members. 

The UCSD administration 
has now become a party to 
this repression by its 
purchase of non-UFW 
grilpe5. Wh ile on the one 
hand we commend the 
adminstration's purchase of 
UFW lettuce we condemn 
the purchase of scab 
gra pes . We urge all 
students, sta ff and faculty 
to BOYCOn GRAPES in all 
UCSD cafeterias and snack 
bars. We also ask for yo ur 
verba l objection to the use 
of scab grapes. Let you r 
feeling be known at the 
cafeterias and snack bars. 
The Uni ted Farm Workers 
need yo ur su pport in their 
struggle for social justice.

PREVIEW 

And Miss Reardon Drinks a LiHle, Paul 
Zindle's latest contribution to mass 
psychosis, is one of the most serious 
comedies this writer has ever seen. The 
characters turn casual comments into 
grotesque numour, mundane incidents 
into perVerted behavior, and items of, 
sorrow into lugubrious tragedies. 

The plot is a groS! caricature of an 
unhealthy family situation, complete ' 
with "sick" friends and neighbors . The 
play does not pack a punch; it convulses 
you with tremendously funny lines and 
action, batters you with truely pitiful 
plights, appalls you disgusting 
personalities, and leave the view with a 
nelpless, resigned attitude toward 
numan nature. It is a sledgehammer of 
negativism. 

Craig Noel has assembled an excellent 
cast, and nas carefully blended their 
interaction to maintain the pace and 
nigh level of intensity inherent in the 
script. The characters each display a 
large variety of the emotional spectrum, 
and the actors change quickly from 
kindness to brutality, from amusement 
to sorrow or bitter sarcasm, with 
tremendous skill and credibility. 

There are moments of awkwardness, 
and occasional over-acting, but it is 
quite understandable in such a 
demanding sc ript. All of tne characters 
are quite neurotic, if not psychotic, and 
the actors and the director are to be 
commended for avoiding turning an 
incredible play into a farce. 

Anne Archer, in the title role of 
Catherine Reardon, turns in an 
exceptional performance. Catherine is a 
perpetually tipsy, romantically frustrated 
~each.er bo.rdering on the edge of 
insanity. MISS Archer carefully tiptoes 
the line of sobriety, elicits great 
sympathy. for Catnerine without making 
us despise her weaknesses, avoids 
indecent displays of her psyche, and 
does it all with grace and, as far as 
possible, beauty. 

The minor characters, Serena Pratt as 
Mrs. Petra no and Randy Herman as the 
delivery boy, add some very welcome 
"light" humour to the play, if you 
discount Mrs , Petrano's morbid (read 
tnat "normal") interest in the mentally ill 
Anna Reardon . 

Flora Richards does an excellent job as

into a film producer's office

Two months ago Onyx Records (a New York 
independent nationally distributed by London 
Records) released a previously unissued set of Tatum 
masterpieces. The disc, entitled GOD IS IN THE 
HOUSE, represents the first in a series of albums from 
the Jerry Newman collection. His collection is 
described as "a unique archive of location recordings 
made in New York in the early 1940's". Newman, an 
ardent jazz fan and owner of portable recording-
equi pment, took every opportunity to record his 
favorite artists at their Harlem club jobs or occassion-

For rock fans who enjoy FLASHY LICKS a la Jeff Beck, 
I hereby present you with the up front so loist who will 
redefine yo ur concepts of solo at its best. Leonard 
Feather, the noted author and music critic for 
Downbeat magazine and the Los Angeles Times, in an 
uncharacteristic burst of enthusiasm called Tatum "the 
greatest soloist in jazz history, regardless of 
instrume]1t". A claim of this nature spurs heated 
debate. The essence though is clear; Tatum should not 
be missed. Give it a try. 

La Jolla Chamber Orchestra Concert 
The La Jolla Chamber Orchestra began its 1973-1974 

season with another well-played concert. Conductor 
John Garvey seems always able to program an 
interesting concert, playing the over-looked works 
along with tne concert standbys. So it was last Friday, 
performing the lesser-known but worthy twentieth-
century works. FiYe V .. riants of Diyes and liIZilrus by 
Ralph Vaughn Williams (1872-1958) and Symphony 
Number 1 by Hans Werner Henze (1926- ) along with 
two concerts fo r gu itar by Vivaldi and the Concierto de 
Ar .. njuez by Joaquin Rodrigo (1902- ), with Angel 

everyone interested in baroque practices. 
Besides the differences in instruments, Romero 

showed that he was much more at home with the 
guitar. Although both concerti were well played, more 
attention payed toward baroque style might have 
projected the concerti better, especia lly in the middle 
movements.

Romero as guitar and lute soloist. 
The Vaughn Williams work suffered from some faulty 

ensemble, but the orchestrial tone was especially rich , 
Including some lovely solo work from the cello. This is 
a ~ke work ariSing from Vaughn Williams' interest in 
British folk music. It is, however, not a very thrilling 
work, and tne tendency towards repitition might have 
been lessened with an emphasis on the inner voices. 
. A dis~ppointing inclusion was the Prelude and Fugue 
In E minor by Bach . The straight arrangement of the 
fou r-voiced piece to the four-voiced orchestra was 
uninteresting and unnecessary . 

Angel Romero, the youngest son of the performing 
Romero quartet, (three brothers and father) , came on 
to perform two Vivaldi concerti, one on the lute and 
one on the guitar. This type of juxtoposition can do 
more to illustrate the similarities and differences 
between the two instruments than pages of writing. 

For those interested, I strongly recommend 
comparison listening to viola da gamba versus a c 110 
and a c1avicnord versus a harpsichord as well as the 
above due: the differences may be surpri ing. 

Also interesting is the differen e b tween a true 
baroque violin and a modern violin ; a must for 

But they were pleasing all the same, and both were 
well received by the capacity audience. 

After intermission, the orchestra played Hans 
Werner Heze's First Symphony, first composed in 1947 
and revi s d for chamber orchestra in 1963. This is very 
difficult music to perform, and Garvey and the 
orchestra must be applauded for both pUlling it on the 
program and playing it well . 

Sometimes a ph'rase was lost in the complexity of the 
orchestration, but the piece as a whole came off as a 
strongly rhythmic and dramatic work. The second 
movement, in particular, was su rprisingly melodi and 
expressive. Maybe Henze's Sheth Sym phony, recently 
written especially for chamber orchestra, will be 
performed in the near future . 

The concert ended with the Concierto de Arilnjuez 
by Rodrigo . This flashy pi ce was pede tly sui ted for 
Romero, wno has almost claimed th pie e as " his 
own" on concert tour, He was in unquestionalbly 
better form for thi exciting panish work than for the 
Vivaldi concerti. 

Although a "contemporary" work , the cone rto is 
richly melodic and romantically traditional in ope. 
The orchestra provided a firm accompanyment

People Are Different their beach mats to cover

man had long black hair 
and spectacles, had not 
been circumcised, and one 
of his toenails had split. He 
told me that he was a 
welde r, and she was a 
social worker: they liked 
Jugoslavian win es and Irish 
folksongs , and had driven 
down the coast in an old 
Volkswagen . . .. 
Continued on pg. 

So m e wo m e n hav e 
c reases across the skin o f 
thei r bell ies, and quite a lot 
of wo men - mo re than 
men, certai nl y - have 
prominen t veins on thei r 
legs. Some peo ple have 
sca rs here and there, from 
append ectomies, 
caesarians, acci dents of 
various kin ds ... So me . . . 

And suddenly I real ised 
that these were th ings that I 
knew about , and that most 
people know about , 
though some are more 
obvious in every -day life 
than are others. I started 
looking at faces again : 
spectacles, moustac hes, 
smiles, scowls, wrinkles, 
plucked eyebrows, broken 
t eth , earrings, and so on , 
The first period, of looking 

at bodies, had lasted for 
perhaps a few minutes -
certainly not more than ' 
half an hou r - and then 
the shapes aro und me

The couple on the mat 
next to me had no watch: 
they asked me the time, in 
German , and we struck up 
a halt ing conversation in 
that language. I noticed 
that the girl had small 
breasts, blond hair , a ' 
promin e nt nose, and no 
wedd ing ring. The young

poignancy to a difficult character. 
William and Trina Bruce portray a 
married couple, Bob and Fleur Stein, 
who bring joy and good tidings into the 
dreary lives of the Reardon sisters on 
their way to the theatre. Fleur attempts 
to endear herself to the married sister of 
Catherine and Anna, Ceil Adams 
(portrayed by Helen Marquardt) , who is 
her supervisor at school. Bob assists 
Fleur in this endeavor by insulting 
everyone on their failings and 

perversion s, 
Miss Reardon is a typical example of 

Zindel 's innocent frivolity and love of 
human nature. It will be offered nightly, 
except Mondays, at the Carter Centre 
State in Balboa Park, with the curtain 
painfully rising at 8PM. 

It is a good production, running until 
October 28th, and you will especially 
enjoy it if you are masochistic, a student 
of abnormal psychology, or just feel like 
being depressed. 

Continued from pg. 6 
Two children ran by, 

barely distinguishable as 
boy and girl. And then the 
people seemed so ordinary 
that they were hardly worth 
watching any more. I 
started thumbing through 
my guidebook. Times of 
ferries. Concerts in the 
town plaza at the weekend. 
The castle ... . 

The castle was first built 
around the 14th Century . . 
.Feet of another girl went 
by, almost stepping on my 
beach towel; but I didn't 
even look up. I'd been 
converted. I chased a fly off 
my nose, straightened my 
towel, rearranged my 
scrotum (it was a hot 
afternoon), let my guide-
book slip to the rocks, and 
dozed in the sunshine. 
People continued to walk 
by, I suppose, stark naked 
- but I'd lost interest in 
watching them. 

On the next day I tried to 
get my wife to join me at 
the same stretch of beach. 
But it was after breakfast : 
then it was too close to 
lunch-time: then we had 
to have lunch: then it 
wasn't good to swim on a 
full stomach. Finally, 
somewhat reluctantly, she 
packed up for the beach -
swim-suit and all - and 
came with me until we 
were about 100 yards from 
the nudist section: and 
then she sat down. She 
pointed out that these 
rocks were just fine for sun-
bathing, and that no useful 
purpose could be served by 
going further. Anyway, she 
had walked far enough. 
Anyway, there was now a 
breeze on the water, and it 
would be too cold to swim 
without a costume. And 
anyway . . . she wasn't the 
kind of person who liked 
that sort of thing. I might 
like that kind of thing, but 
she didn't. Some people 
do, she said, and some 
people don'~. Anyway, it 
was no good arguing, she 
emphasized; she just 
wasn 't going to change her 
mind. I had to realize that 
people are different - and 
that's that! 

I didn't argue. Sadly, I 
had 10 admit that she was 
right . People are different. 
That had been obvious 
from the start. 

Musical Notes 
Continued from pg. 5 
electronic effects, strobes, 
and high energy music. 

Also on the October 4 
bill at tRe Civic Th'eatre is 
Eumir Deodata and his 
band DEODATO. Eumir 
Deodata is an unassuming, 
r ather mysterious 
composer and entertainer. 
He only came into the 
public eye recently with he 
re ndition of Strauss' " Also 
S prach Zarathustra" 
commonly known as "2001 : 
A Space Odyssey." 

Deodata hails from Rio 
d E: Janeiro, Brazil, and 
learned piano by sending 
away for books outside of 
Brazil. At 13 he took accor-

d ~an lessons which taught 
him Some music theory. He 
has his Own writing system 
and can compose anything 
Without the assistance of 
instruments. 

Deodato 's music has a 
latin-jazz feeling often 
rooted in classical themes. 
H.is new group consists of 
nine ~usicians, blending 
acoustic and electric instru-
ments. This new group is 
rna.de of the people who 
aSSisted him on his latest 
album Deodato 2 with the 
hit single, Rhilpsody In 
Blue. 

When this 25-year-old researcher 
wanted to investigate 

a possible cancer treatment, 
we gave him the go-ahead. 

We also gave him the right to fail. 
At Kodak, it's not unusual for a 25-year-old like Jim 

Carroll to win the title of senior research physicis t . Like any 
company involved in a lot of basic r arch, Kodak has fe lt 
the pressure of modern technology and the need for young, 
fresh thinking. So we hire the best tale nt we possibly can , 
and then give them as much responsibility as they can han -
dle. Whatever their age. 

We have departments and division. , like any company . 
What we don't have are preconceived ideas about how a n 
expert scientist's time shou.ld be spent. So when we received 
a request from the medical community for is tance in x-
perimenting with lasers as a possible cancer treatment, we 
turned to 25-year-old Jim Carroll, who is deep in la r tech-

nology, and gave him the go-ahead. H e built two ha lf-billion 
watt laser syste ms, one of which Kodak h as donated to the 
National Ins titu te of H ealth. 

The lasers prov d unsuccessful in trea ting cancer, but 
we'd make the same decision all ov r again . We ,>ntered laser 
technology becau e we h ave a stake in busine>s. We let a 
young res a rcher help t he medical communit) look for n 
m ans of can cer treatment because we have a ~take in the 
future of ma nkind. 

'Ib put jt anothe r way, w 're in bu ine to make a 
profit. But in furthering our own n eeds, \. I..... "r II i \.ll-
th red socie ty's. Arter a ll , our bu in depends on our soci-
e ty . So we ca r what ha ppens to it. 

Kodak 
More than a business.
