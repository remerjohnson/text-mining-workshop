Talking Back to Television: 
Public Access on Cable TV 
Any person in the United States can now show their videotapes or 

films on television on a newly-created public access cable channel. 
, San Diego's public access station is Mission Cable channel 24, run 
hy thc Community Video Center. 

Channel 24's manager, St ve Crouch, and production man~ger, 
An ne Prutzman, were both communications majors at UC San DlCgo. 
In addition several UCSD interns are conducting independent studics 
for credit ~t the station. Channel 24 is located on Federal Blvd . in 
southeast San Diego. 

A recent Federal Communications Commission ruling states that 
very community located within a major television market is required 

to have at least one cable TV channel made available free to the 
public. The channel must also make available equipment and a ~tudio 
on a first-come, first-served basis, to any individual or group 10 the 
commt:nily. (Another channel goes towards the municipality and a 
third to educators). 

The limitations placed upon any production are few: no blatent 
('ommercial advertising; no political candidates running for office ; no 
lotterics; and no obscenity or offensive material. Other than that , 
every tape or film that follows the rules can be put on a public access 
channel. 

To Promote Access 
The Community Video Center (CVC) is a non-profit, tax-exempt . 

community group whose goal is to promote access. The evc has 
contracted with Mission Cable to manage the public access channel 
for them. Mission Cable has provided CVC with their own equipment, 
space and office. There are four paid staff whose salaries are 
generated by CVC activities, grants and donations. 

Public access TV is not to be confused with local origination TV, 
which is represented by cable Channel 2 on Mission Cable, and UHF -
Channel 15 at State College in San Diego. They are non-commercial 
stations run like regular commercial TV stations, with a live 
origination studio, film chain, and distribution center. 

In order to maintain the goal of public access, evc is trying to gain

Confidentiality 
Explored by 
UC Committee 

A UC committee has urged that 
the University continue to use 
confidential evaluations in its 
review process, but recommended 
that a few changes alJowing in-
dividuals to learn the substance of 
their personal records be made. 

The Special Committee on 
Personnel R cords submitted that 
report to President Saxon on 
Monday. 

In October, Saxon appointed the 
eight-member committee to 
review UC policies regarding 
employee personnel files . 

Much of the impetus for the 
committee came from Gov , 
Brown's veto of a bill which would 
have required full disclosure of the 
contents of his personnel file to a 
public employee. UC officials 
urged the veto of the bill because of 
the alleged serious adverse impact 
it would have in the peer review 
process in faculty evaluation. 

UC agreed to work with Brown 
and the legislature to develop a 
measure incorporating the intent 
of the original bill while still 
protecting their own interests. 

7000 People to Sample Peanut Butter This Week 
The committee's report states 

that a degree of confidentiality is 
needed to obtain accurate 
evaluations of the UC faculty . 
" Experts in an academic field, 
able to provide useful appraisals of 
the quality of work of a UC faculty 
member, are, we believe, much 
less likely to provide these in-
dispensible critical evaluation if 
their letters of evaluation are not 
kept confidential," the report said.

City Editor 

Over 7000 people will sample 
peanut butter at UC San Diego this 
week. 

That is the hope of Jay Russo, an 
assistant professor of Psychology, 
who is conducting the largest 
psychological experiment in the 
history of UCSD. 

Russo, conducting a survey for 
his personal research, hopes to 
prove that consumers are not 
stupid or ignorant about perceiving 
quality in products. 

Russo said that peanut butter is a 
good product to test his theory. " It 
has one central attribute: how 
good does it taste?" 

Approximately 50 ' volunteer 
experimenters-many of them 
psychology undergraduates-wiIJ 

join Russo in manning three booths 
around UCSD today through 
Friday. From 10:30 to 2:30 there 
will be booths in both the Revelle 
and Muir Plaza, and another in 
front of the bookstore. In the 
evening volunteers will staff 
stations at the cafeterias. 

Volunteers from the campus 
community will be sought at the 
testing stations to sample two 
different brands of peanut butter 
and then asked to judge which 
tastes more like fresh roasted 
peanuts. Russo said that whether 
or not a brand tastes like fresh 
roasted peanuts is the major 
determiner of its quality according 
to Consumer Reports Magazine. 

He hopes to obtain a rating of the 
seven brands of peanut butter 
based on the preferences of the 
volunteers. 

Store Brands 

One of the goals of the ex-
periment is to see how store 
brands, which are usually cheaper, 
stand in relation to major brands. 
Two brands, Nu Made and Real 
Roast, are store brands. 

The other brands to be tested 
are : fresh ground peanuts with no 
additives, Jif, Laura Scudders, 
Peter Pan and Skippy. 

According to Russo, 7000 taste 
tests required the purchase of 
approximately $150 wOrth of 
peanut butter. 

" Consumer g roups will be 
pleased that reliable quality in-
formation will be available. 
Retailers will be pleased because 
their own store brands might offer 
good quality at a low price. They 
can do this of course because their 

Sell Concerned ove r Power of Agency 

FBI Termed'Federal Bureau of Intimidation' 
by Brian Davis 

Staff Writer . 
Characterizing the FBI as the " Federal Bureau of 

Intimidation," Socialist Worker's Party speaker 
Evelyn Sell voiced her concern over the power of the 
domestic intelligence community in the United 
tates. 

Evelyn Sen 

S II , who sa id that her teaching position in AUllt in, 
Texas was terminated last year as a result of FBI 
PI' ssure, spoke to a small gathering of sympathizers 
Thursda~1 e\'cning in the north conference room of the 
student center. Following her was Greg Akili of the 
US organization. 

Sell said that he was but one of a large number of 
kachel'S harassed for involvement in the anti-war 
movement in the 60s. She claimed tha t sh has b en 
under continuous surveillance since the founding of 
the Socialist Worker's Party (SWP ) in ]948. 

Sells said after sh accepted a position in Austin in 
1969, numerous inquiri s w re mad into her 
background by th loca l chool board, a a result of 
an active anti-war stand at Ute chooJ. 

The FBI, she says, secretly turne41 over to the 
school board a list of I ft wing activitie h had 
partiCipated in; and she lost her job early in 1970. She 
stressed that none of the activities violated the law.

Welcome News 

The survey will be welcome news 
for just about everyone except the 
manufacturers of inferior peanut 
butter, Russo asserted. 

Russo, who has a PhD in 
mathematical psychology and has 
been marketing research con-
sultant to Proctor and Gamble as 
well as publishing a number of 
articles consumer decision 
making, says that consumers look 
at three product attributes in 
making their purchasing decision : 
price, size and overall quality . 

" If you want to help shoppers 
make better decisions, the biggest 
improvement can be made in 
quality , because size and price are 
numerical, and must be clearly 
posted by law. Consumers have 
reasonable price and size in-
formation available. Quality, on 
the other hand, is not numerical ,

Chilling Effect 
The report continued, "If it were 

the policy to make all letters of 
evaluation of an individual 
available to that individual, this 
policy would have a chilling effect 
upon persons from whom letters of 
evaluation are solicited." 

The report recommends that 
employees be given the op-
portunity to learn the substance, 
but not the source of the con-
fidential evaluations. 

The committee 's report stated, 
"Any employee shall have the 
opportunity to inspect all non-
confidential documents in any of 
the personnel files of that em-
ployee, and upon written request, 
to receive from an appropriate 
authority an oral summary of the

Slush-Fund Economics 
Things were looking up last week. 
Gov. Brown had presented a budget package that Included allocations 

of state money to UC that, wblle not equalliJlg the University's request, 
seemed to satisfy President Saxon and other officials. 

Then came the announcement from Berkeley that Saxon would 
probably not ask the Board of Regents for an increase in the registration 
fl'e, an Increase that bad been anticipated by student groups aod the nine 
reg fee committees on the campuses. 

Thursday tbe Los Angeles Times reported, tbough, that Brown Is 
refusing to propose oyerenrollment funds for 3000 extra students, 

unr~pected students who will enter the University this year and next year 
and who will need money - about $4.7 million, it is estimated - for 
traching assistants and other instructional support. 

This is the first time the state has refused to propose overenrollment 
money for the University, It appears to have been the card up the 
Governor's sleeve. 

Brown has talked often of making UC more accountable to the people of 
the state. In choosing not to provide overenrollment money - for students 
the University is committed to instructing, whether It has the money or 
not - Brown thinks he will force the University to make the 'hard choices' 
he has been urging of it since his administration began. 

He suggested, for instance, that money in the proposed budget destined 
fur instructional improvement - apparently the line labelled "Enrich 
Instructional Support" - be used to partially offset overenrollment. That 
amount, about $3.9 million, bas no specific strings on it, and can be used 
for anything the University wants, within reason. 

In forcing accountability in this manner, Brown is obscuring any real 
accountability that may exist now, The state legislature has long insisted 
that money approved for the University be spent at least roughly In the 
area the funds were budgeted for. Brown is, in essence, encouraging 
slush fund economics, in which, eventually, the people will have 110 way at 
all of knowing where their money is spent. 

The legislature, which has the budget now, can add the money for 
nverenrollment if it doesn' t want to allow the precedent Brown is trying to 
set. But the governor has veto power over any part or parts of the 
California budget. 

There are other issues, of course, It is not right that money intended for 
enhancement of every student' s educational experience at UC - perhaps 
money for the TAs, lab equipment or other support - he used to pay for 
students who should he provided for separately, 

However, for the very reason that we think it is doubtful students would 
ha ve ever felt the benefits of that $3,9 million, we fee l Brown's method for 
furc ing accountability will further lessen it. The time has come for Brown 
to point himself to the areas be feels are eccessive in the University's 
planning. He should help us make the 'hard choices' he believes need 
making. 

"Well, at leastwe won't have to put up with 
those pesky tourists anymore ... "

Feminist Coalition Holds First Meeting 
The Feminist Coalition held its 

first major organizational meeting 
last Wednesday with an attendance 
of twenty women. The prodigious 
size of the meeting reflects the 
sentiment in UCSD women that 
there are still issues to be dealt 
with, even though we do have the 
vote, we do have female 
congressmen and the Equal 
Rights Amendment will surely be 
passed, 

An element of unrest is being 
expressed by women, The idea 
that the Women's Movement has 
died is vomitus, The reality is that 
we have been maturing into 
committed challengers to the 
status-quo, and the revolution we 
are making is one on every front: 
economic, political, cultural, 
personal, public, sexual, 
biological and even metaphysical. 

The Feminist Coalition does not 
want UCSD women to lose touch 
with the women on the " outside." 
We are now in the process of 
organizing carpools to the founding 
meeting of a San Diego pro-ERA 
coalition at the YWCA, Wed-
nesday, Jan, 28th, Other car-pools 
are fonning for the February 7th 
ERA conference at Los Angeles 
City College, Although the 
amendment has been passed in 
California, we realize that the ERA 

is still not "safe," If four more 
states do not ratify the ERA by 
1979, those sb!tes that have wiU not 
malter, If the federal amendment 
is defeated, the stale amendments 
are automatically dissolved, 

The Feminist Coalition projects 
ERA activities for the winter 

quarter. We wanl to be able to 
explain the ERA and clear its 
status from the misconceptions 
that have surrounded it. Come to 
our next meeting, Wednesday, Jan, 
28,4 pm at the Women's Center, 

THE FEMINIST COAlJTION 

'We Can't Stop Progress' 
The following is based on in-

formation gathered from the 
student secretary upstairs in the 
student .center and from a phone 
conversation with Dave Ernst who 
works in the vice chancellor's 
office, 

" They ' re going to build a 
commer.cial center across the 
street from school." " No?" " On 
the La Jolla Farms Stables. 
Apartments. Clothing stores. 
McDonalds Food stores. You know 
the shops that spring up around 
campuses." "That 's too bad: I like 
seeing the horses when I drive to 
school. Of course the smell-but it 
beats the smoke of greasy 
burgers," " We can't stop it. It 's 
progress they used to say," " But 
that's history, The earth is all of 
ours and we're all responsible for 
it : land contractors as well as 

nature lovers. I hope we can 
preserve some wildness amidst the 
humanity,,," 

fhe time has come to decide the 
future of two pieces of property 
owned by the university : the land 
on which the La Jolla Farms 
Stables stands, and " knoll," the 
open field above Black's beach, 
These areas were to be used for the 
campus when tJCSD reached its 12 
college size, but in the evolution of 
plans for growth, these spots were 
overlooked until recently, 

Selection Committee to Meet 

The first question the school is 
considerin/( is. " Should th e 
university hold onto the land?" 
The land is untaxable because it is 
university owned, State Senator 
Stull has said the land should be 
sold to generate tax. A Board of 
Overseers, whose function is to 
represent local interests, has 
suggested that. the University keep 
the land. The Board said the knoll 
was too unique to consider 
developing now. They said that 
building on the stables land would 
be economically feasible and if 
developed, building on the land 
should be conducted in phases. 

Otis Watson, a senior and Third 
College intern, was recently a~ 
pointed to serve on the advisory 
conunittee to Gov. Brown on the 
selection of the UC Regents, 
Watson is the only student on the 
board : his appointment was made 
by the Student Body President's 
Council of the UC, The following is 
a statement by him,

The next meeting of the com-

Friday, we met at UC Berkeley to 
approve policy and selection 
procedures. other key figures on 
the board include Leo McCarthy, 
Sen, James Mills , and Mrs, 
Edward Heller, Chairman of the 
Board of Regents, 

" I believe that every UC student 
should be aware of the selection 
process of the new Regents, being 
that the Regents are the overseers 
of the University, The two Regents 
will serve twelve year terms each, 

" I plan to support a Chicano as 
one of the appointees, and I am 
presently lobbying more support 
throughout the state. My reasons 
are twofold. First, I feel that

ethnic minority groups, Second,

Iowa Sends Her Best 
You have probably seen the television commercial by a certain meat 
cker that claims that Iowa sends her best as score~ of plucky farmers 

pa d h f ct workers are hard at work prodUCing the finest bacon 
an c eer~ ~he o~rld for the consumption of the American public, an~ ~~;: wee:Iowa received a treat from the rest of the country as the 
fÂ· et po' litical hams in the nation congregated in that state to joust for the Ines nd h I't' l tÂ· I asure ofIowa's ha att e po I Ica conven IOns. 
p ~t Monday evening thousands of Iowans joined together at ~e 
multitude of Iowan precincts for Phase One of the delegate selectIOn 
process. In this first stage of the Iowa process, delegates were selected 
from each precinct. Later in the spring, at district and statewide con-
ventions, these delegates will pick the best that Iowa can offer for 
showcase at the national conventions. 

tn the Democratic precinct caucases there was a flurry of surprises, 
First, Morris Udall and Sergent Shriver, both of whom had done some 

campaigning and had expected to do quite well, .did not. Their .dism~ 1 
showing rivaled the vote that Earl Browder might have received In 
Orange County a few years ago, Shriver had only 3,4 percent of the 
delegates while Udall nearly doubled the Shriver total at 5.9 percent of 
the vote, 

Failed to Excite 
Another victim of a poor showing was Sen, Henry Jackson, Though 

Jackson had barely campaigned in the Hawkeye State, one must wonder 
what happened to his alleged support, He was the only candidate of the 
Democratic right-a relative term I assure you-yet, as usual he failed to 
excite voters from a state with another name than Washington, 

Second, was the fine showing of former Georgia Gov, Jimmy Carter, 
who managed to walk away with nearly 28 percent of the vote, Carter has 
been a tireless campaigner and his populist ideas obviously made a 
positive impression upon the voters of a state that went for William 
Jennings Bryan during the heyday of populism. Carter was the largest 
vote getter of any of the six announced candidates. 

Free Choice 
The biggest surprize, though, was that 37 percent of the voters selected 

uncommitted delegates. These delegates will go to the state convention 
and later to the national convention with a free choice as to whom they 
will select for the nomination, 

Walter Cronkite, in his CBS Radio commentary last Tuesday said that 
many of these delegates may be stand-ins for Hubert Humphrey. One 
might also presume that many of these delegates will be representing 
organized labor, which pulls no weak punch when it comes to electIOn-
eering. Though there was no indication in the press , one can also wonder 
whether George Wallace had any support among the uncommi~ted 
delegates. In Saturday's Mississippi caucases, Geo~ge ~allace surpnz~d 
eve ryone with his ability to put together an orga~lzatlOn that could ,wln 
that sort of political fight as well as primary elections. Wallace rece,lved 
ove r 40 percent of the vote, in a five man race which saw uncommitted 
delegates draw 26 percent. Carter was a distant second with only 16 
percent. . . . 

Back in Iowa, Birch Bayh and Fred HarrIS did not do poorly With 13,3 
percent and 10,1 percent of the vote respectively; but those uncommitted 
de legates and the Carter vote appear to be significant for Democrats, 

Democrats in Iowa are not too happy with the current crop of can-
didates, The only candidate that had an impressive vote total has a 
definite anti-Washington tinge to his campaign. 

Is But the First Test 
Still, Iowa is only the first test, and with only 47 delegates it cannot be 

looked at too importantly, 
On the Republican side of the fence, delegates selected were not 

committed to any candidate but were elected for reasons of personality or 
local interest. Thus, it is difficult to tell how the delegates will vote in 
Kansas City. 

There was a straw poll taken in two percent of the precincts, Both the 
Ford and Reagan campaigns claimed victory. Ford had 45 percent of the 
vote while Reagan had 42 percent. However the vote total vas so small 
that it seems pointless to even speculate on what the results mean except 
to say that Reagan is a strong and viable candidate in a state where Ford 
has extensive support, -

So in the first official week of the Presidential sweepstakes the hams 
have had their say while the voters have had theirs, Still, there is no trend 
except continu ing confusion.

Trickster Tuck: Truth Through Irreverence 

by Mark Stadler 
News Editor 

Political trickster Dick Tuck 
does not like to call his activities 
pranks; instead he says he deals in 
irreverence. 

Tuck spoke of his 25 year career 
in irreverence last Thursday night 
at Montgomery Jr. High School in 
a program sponsored by the Mesa 
College Community Services 
program. 

Tuck, who is prima rily known for 
the many political tricks he played 
on former President Richard 
Nixon, said the purpose of his 
political career was two-fold : one 
serious and one humorous, Tuck 
said in his career he has tried to 
dramatize things that he (eels the 
voters should know about a can-
didate as well as poke fun at self-
serious politicians, 

Truth and Relevance 
Tuck told the highly receptive 

audience. of 200 that he always 
asked himself two questions about 
a political trick-is what he would 
dramatize true, and is it relevant 
to the issues of the campaign. 

In an example of the former 
Tuck ~ave an anecdote of Nixon's 
1962 California gubernatorial 
campaign, Tuck was working for 
Nixon's opponent, Edmund G. 
Brown, Sr" and they were trying to 
let the people know about a 

Fourth Reporter 

possibly compromising connection 
betwee n Nixon and Howard 
Hughes, 

(In 1956 Nixon's brother, Donald, 
had received an unsecured loan of 
$206,000 from Hughes,) 

When Nixon campaigned in Los 
Angeles's Chinatown Tuck had 
signs painted in Chinese saying 
" What about the Hughes loan?" 

When Nixon discovered what the 
signs said he was unhappy, to say 
the least. 

The other reason Tuck began in 
political tricksterism was to point 
out the human side of American 
politicians, " Politicians are not 
kings," he said. "Not gods, 
They're just human beings and 
so metime they need a little 

irreverent treatment. " 
Watergate 

Tuck never really addressed the 
question of whether he spawned 
the dirty tricks of Watergate with 
his activities , He spoke with 
professional pride, though, to the 
difference between himself and the 
Watergate people, saying that the 
antics of Watergate trickster 
Donald Segretti were " not only 
counterproductive, but wrong." 

Tuck said that he would not enter 
into the 1976 presidential campaign 
"unless Nixon does." 

" Two people I never bury are 
Nixon and (former Los Angeles 
mayor ) Sam Yorty," he said, 
" You better put a big rock on

San Di ego Thursday at 8 pm in the 
Revelle Cafeteria, Her topic will 
be " The Status of Women in 
American Society," a subject 
which she will approach from her 
own unique v.iewpoint, treating it 
with that Johnston brand of humor 
that has made her a noted member 
of the women's movement. 

Johnston, who considers herself 

an artist first, and a feminist 
second, has been a columnist since 
1959. She wrote her first published 
feminist article in 1968, at the 
beginning of the current feminist 
movement. Her books include 
"Mar melade Me" and " Lesbian 
Nation," A new book entitled " My 
Father in Amerika" will appear at 
the end of this year, 

The event, being sponsored by 
the UCSD Women 's Resource 
Center, is free and open to the 
public, '

" In putting together this symposium we have tried

UC San Diego Community," said Gary J . Frost. Dean 
of Fourth College . " Human sexuality is a subject of 
c011 ntless racet~ , and by these diverse lectul'es and 
ciis('ussions, we hope to touch upon many issues of 
imporlance, " 

Speaking tonight will be nationally known sex 
Ilwrapists Dr. Theresa L. Crenshaw and Dr. Robert 
T, Crensh<lw. They will discuss many of the sexual 
m,I'ths and misconceptions that permeate society, as 
\\"('11 as some of the problems encountered in sexual 
rl'lationshi ps. As with all of the programs, blank 
mdt'x carris will be passed out so people can ask 
:1l10nymolls questi ons.

there will be a free showing of the movie, "Sunday. 
11100<ly, Sunday ." The film evolves a round a husband-

.Jac'kson. 

Sex in the iOs 
At 7:30 Wcdnesday evening in the Fourth College 

i{('(Tcation Ccnlel' there will be a discussion on sex, 
rel ig ion. a nd va lucs in lhe 70s, Speaking will be Les 
Atkinson of the United Campus Ministries, and Fr. 
I1t'mil' Cilmpbell, UCSD Catholic Chaplain. Primary 

among thc topics will be pre-marital sex and the 
church.

day's evening presentation of " Female Sexuality." 
Recky Combs, a San Diego sex counselor, will lead a 
t,llk and answer questions , Included will be the recent 
KPBS panel conference on women and sex, with 
tnpil'S featuring a woman's sexual needs, femalc 
Ix'alth, and undcrstanding of a woman's body and 
rape. 

The following week on Monday, at 7:30, in the

Cafeteria. Male and female contraceptive devices 
will be discussed by J udy Goldfinch o( the Birth 
Control Clinic, as well as the issue of responsibility 
towards sex partners, 

"These progra ms arc designed to give information 
to the most sexually experienced as well as the least 
('xperienced." said Frost. "When I used to teach, I 
sometimes gave a surprise test on sexual knowledge. 
and was con Â·tanUy a mazed at the lack and misun-
derstilnding of information that the students knew. It 
IS a filct that the so-called sexual revolution is not a 
r~1 rt of milny student's lives. We urge all those in-
It'l"l'sted. and most people are interested in sex, to 
<ll\enll ."

.San Diego Symphony Outshined by Guest 

by Daniel Shawler 
Arts Editor 

Once again, ; the San Diego 
Symphony was outplayed by its 
guest artist; in the case of last 
Friday by pianist Gina Baehauer. 
Her performance of ~he faf!10us 
piano concerto No.2 111 C mill or, 
Op. 18 by Sergei Raclunaninoff was 
as much a marvel to see as it was 
to hear. 

Bachauer, a former student of 
Rachmaninoff, is one of the Grand 
Dames of the concert world . She 
can evoke dignity simply by the 
way she walks on the stage. It was 
even more present when she 
s ituated herself at the piano and 
began the a ustere opening chords 
of the concerto. As soon as 
Bachauer reached the rolling 
arpegios (broken chords), 
however, all pretensions of dignity 
vanished as her hands and anns 
flew over the keyboard. 

The first movement of the 
concerto was too visual. The 

audience had to rely more on sight 
than on sound to receive the full 
value of the music because the 
orchestra-piano balance was 
terrible . It was virtually im-
possible to hear Baehauer 
throughout much of the first 
movement. The orchestra and 
piano we re moving on separa tr 
dyn!Jmic planes, becoming loud 
and soft together , but always out of 
halancc . 

There was a marked im-
provement of balance in the second 
movement which was played in a 
beautiful, almost flawless, albeit 
technical, manner . Instead of 
being a deterrent, as in the first 
movement, the balance proved to 
be an asset. Basically the same 
statement could be made con-
cerning the third movement. 

The only problem with 
Baehauer's perfonnance was its 
extreme technical nature. She 
sounded almost like a machine, 
mechanically blocking the rhyth-
ms and placing too much emphasis 

LOSE 20 POUNDS 
IN TWO WEEKS III 

Famous U.S. Women Ski Team Diet 
During the non-snow off seosan the U.S. Women's Alpine Ski Team 

members go on the "Ski Team" diet to lose 20 pounds in two weeks . 
Thol's rlghl -- 20 pounds in 14 doys! The bos is of the d iet is chemical 
food oction ond wos devised by 0 fomous Colorado physician 
especiall y for Ihe U.S. Ski Team. Normol energy is maintained (very 
importont! ) while reducing . You keep " full " -- no slorvotion -- because 
the diet is designed that way. It's a diet that is easy 10 follow whether 
you work , lrovel or stay at home . 

This is honeslly a fantastically successful d iel. If is weren 't, Ihe U.S. 
Women's Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! Right? So. g ive 
yoursel f Ihe some break the U.S. Ski Team gets. Lose weight the 
scientifIC, proven woy . Even if you' ve tried 011 the other d iets, you owe 
it to yourself to try the U.S. Women 's Ski Team Diet. T~at is, if you 
reotly do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks. Order toda y. Tea r this 
out as 0 reminder. 

Send only $2.00 [$2.25 for Rush Service] - cash is O.K. to; R.D.S . 
Products, P.O. Box 834, Dept. 19, Del Mar, Cal iforn io 92014. Don 't 
order unless you wont to lose 20 pounds in two weeksl Because that 's 
what the Sk i Team Diet is designed to do!! 

on the superficial phrase struc-
tures. If she had allowed tr > work 
to emote more naturally, even at 
thc expense of some rhythmic 
precision, Bachauer would have 
been much better. 

Th~ sy mphony opened the 
evening with an uninspired perÂ· 
formance of Liszt's " Mephisto 
Waltz, Op. 110." In fact , at times , 
the performance was very poor. 
The strings were disorganized , and 
the trumpets were so bad that they 
almost ruined the entire piece. 

The remainder of the concert 
was much improved. It was indeed 
a pleasure to listen to the " Two 
Roumanian Dances," by Bartok-
Weiner. The finale, the Concert 
Suite from Bartok 's " The 
Miraculous Mandarin" was, with 
the exception of the trumpet 
section, very good. Once again , the 
trumpets showed that they were 
the bane of the orchestra. For-
tunately, though, the rest of the 
symphony managed to play around 
them, leading the concert to a 
successful conclusion. 

Tuck . . 
Nixon's sepulchre," he added. 

On a variety of other topics Tuck 
said : 

-Presidential candidate Jimmy 
Carter: " He always reminds me of 
a kid with a note pinned to his 
sweater who's wa iting at the bus 
stop to go to camp"; 

-President Ford: " The only 
suspense in his campaign is what 
he will do next to help Reagan"; 

-Presidential candidate Ronald 
Reagan : " People call him an 
actor like it's something bad-but 
being an actor certainly isn 't as 
bad as being a politician." 

-The Nixon White House tapes: 
" They reminded me of a Woody 
Allen movie." 

-The future of humor in politics : 
" There will a lways be pompous 
politicians who take themselves 
too seriously. " 

ANNOUNCEMENT 

TRUCKER 
A Portrait of the Last America n Cowboy 

By Jane Stern 
McGrawÂ·Hill , $12.50 cloth, $6.95 paper, 165 pp. 

The trucker, a lonesome romantic who rides the interstates as his 
forebears rode the range, finally gets his due in this study in words and 
pictures by a woman whose prose throbs and pulses in perfect time with 
the lives of the gearjammers who cruise the roads for a living. 

T~e modern truck~r, a~ she points out and her perceptive photographs 
testify , even looks hke his 19th-century counterpart, right down to the 
tooled leather boots, the wide-brim hat, and the deep lines in the 
weathered faces of men grown old before their time from riding too hard 
too fast. 

Stern chronicles the trucker's history (cowboy to railroad man to 
~rucke.r ), de~cribes his tr~cks (up to .$75,000 for a tractor-trailer rig), 
IIltervlews his lovers (waitresses, Wives, whores, hitchhikers fellow 
truckers ), apotrophizes his roads and truck stops, and even h~s a few 
words on his soul (there are truck-driving poets) and his future (which 
includes blacks and women ). 

" Trucker" was three years in the making, and it is a sensitive look at a 
~tereotyped profession. Jane Stern 's m.arriage of words to images makes 
It a JOY to read, and, except for some mexcusably sloppy editing it is a 
flawless and fascinating work. '

.San Diego Symphony O utshined by Guest 

by Daniel Shawler 
Arts Editor 

Onee again" the San Diego 
Symphony was outplayed by its 
guest artist; in th~ case of last 
Friday by pianist GlOa Baehauer. 
Her performance of .the fa~ous 
piano concerto No. 2 III C mlllor, 
Op. 18 by Sergei Rachmaninoff was 
as much a marvel to see as it was 
to hear . 

Bachauer, a former student of 
Rac/unaninoff, is one of the Grand 
Dames of the concert world. She 
ca n evoke dignity simply by the 
way she walks on the stage. It was 
even more present when she 
situated herself at the piano and 
began the austere opening chords 
of the concerto. As soon as 
Bachauer reached the rolling 
arpegios (broken chords), 
however, all pretensions of dignity 
vanished as her hands and arms 
flew over the keyboard. 

The first movement of the 
concerto was too visual. The 

audience had to rely more on sight 
than on sound to receive the full 
value of the music because the 
orchestra-piano balance was 
terrible. It was virtually imÂ· 
possible to hear Bachauer 
throughout much of the first 
movement. The orchestra and 
piano were moving on separ~t(' 
d~'namic planes, becoming loud 
and soft together, but always out of 
balance. 

There was a marked im-
provement of balance in the second 
movement which was played in a 
beautiful, almost flawless, albeit 
teclU1ical, manner. Instead of 
being a deterrent, as in the first 
movement, the balance proved to 
be an asset. Basically the same 
statement could be made con-
cerning the third movement. 

The only problem with 
Bachauer's performance was its 
extreme technical nature. She 
sounded almost like a machine, 
mechanically blocking the rhyth-
ms and placing too much emphasis 

LOSE 20 POUNDS 
IN TWO WEEKS III 

Famous U.S. Women Ski Team Diet 
During the nonÂ·snow off season the U.S. Women's Alpine Ski Team 

members go on the "Ski Team" diet 10 lose 20 pounds in two weeks. 
That's right -- 20 pounds in 14 days! The basis of Ihe diet is chemical 
food action and was devised by a famous Colorado physician 
especially for the U.S_ Ski Team. Normal energy is mainta ined (very 
important!) while reducing. You keep "full" -- nostarvalion -- because 
the diet is designed thai way. It 's a diet that is eosy to follow whether 
you work, travel or stay at home . 

This is honestly a fantaslically successful diet. If is weren't, the U.S. 
Women's Ski Team wouldn'l be permiffed to use it! Right? So, give 
yourself the some break the U.S. Ski Team gets. lose weIght the 
scienlific. proven way. Even if you've tried all the olher diels , you owe 
it to yourself to try the U.S. Women's Ski Team Diet. T~ot is, if you 
reatly do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks. Order today. Tear this 
out os a rem inder . 

Send only $2.00 r$2.25 for Rush Servicel - cosh is O.K. to : R.D.S. 
Products. P.O. Box 834, Dept. 19, Del Mar, California 920)4. Don't 
order unless you wont to lose 20 pounds in two weeh! Because that 's 
what the Ski Team Diet is designed to doll 

on the superficial phrase struc-
tures. If she had allowed tJ>n work 
to emote more naturally, even at 
the expense of some rhythmic 
precision, Bachauer would have 
been much better. 

The symphony opened the 
evening with an uninspired per-
formance of Liszt's " Mephisto 
Waltz, Op. 110." In fact , at times, 
the performance was very poor. 
The strings were disorganized, and 
the trumpets were so bad that they 
almost ruined the entire piece. 

The remainder of the concert 
was much improved. It was indeed 
a pleasure to listen to the " Two 
Roumanian Dances," by BartokÂ· 
Weiner. The finale, the Concert 
Suite from Bartok 's "The 
Miraculous Mandarin" was, with 
the exception of the trumpet 
section, very good. Once again, the 
trumpets showed that they were 
the bane of the orchestra. For-
tunately, though, the rest of the 
symphony managed to play around 
them, leading the concert to a 
successful conclusion. 

Tuck . . 
Nixon's sepulchre," he added. 

On a variety of other topics Tuck 
said: 

-Presidential candidate Jimmy 
Carter: " He always reminds me of 
a kid with a note pinned to his 
sweater who's waiting at the bus 
stop to go to camp" ; 

-President Ford : " The only 
suspense in his campaign is what 
he will do next to help Reagan"; 

-Presidential candidate Ronald 
Reagan: " People call him an 
actor like it's something bad-but 
being an actor certainly isn't as 
bad as being a politicia n. " 

-The Nixon White House tapes : 
" They reminded me of a Woody 
Allen movie." 

-The future of humor in politics : 
" There will always be pompous 
politicians who take themselves 
too seriously. " 

ANNO UNCEMENT 

TRUCKER 
A Portrait of the Last American Cowboy 

By Jane Stern 
McGraw-HilI , $12.50 cloth, $6.95 paper, 165 pp. 

The trucker, a lonesome romantic who rides the interstates as his 
fore bears rode the range, finally gets his due in this study in words and 
pictures by a woman whose prose throbs and pulses in perfect time with 
the lives of the gearjammers who cruise the roads for a living. 

T~e modern trucker, as she points out and her perceptive photograplis 
testify, even looks hke his 19th'century counterpart, right down to the 
tooled leather boots, the wide-brim hat, and the deep lines in the 
weathered faces of men grown old before their time from riding too hard 
too fast. 

Stern chronicles the trucker's history (cowboy to railroad man to 
~rucke.r), de~cribes his tr~cks (up to . $75,000 for a tractor-trailer rig), 
mtervlews his lovers (waItresses, Wives, whores, hitchhikers fellow 
truckers ), apotrophizes his roads and truck stops, and even h~ a few 
words on his soul (there are truck-driving poets ) and his future (which 
includes blacks and women) . 

" Trucker" was three years in the making, and it is a sensitive look at a 
stereotyped profession. Jane Stern's marriage of words to images makes 
it a joy to read, and, except for some inexcusably sloppy editing it is a 
nawless and fascinating work. '

St, Writer world tyranny" by the United for its peoples. 

AmbaS8adl~1 Rikhi Jaipal, 
Permanent ~presentative of 
India to the Unit@d Nations, spoke 
at the UC Sar. Diego International 
Center Wednesday evening on the 
topic of "The So-called Tyranny of 
the Majority in the UN. " 

Jaipal began his talk by 
providing his 'listeners with some 
background information. He 
explained that the UN is composed 
of 144 member nations, 110 of 
which are considered " developing 
countries." Included in this group 
of third world powers is India. 

The UN is financially supported 
by its member natiolls; the budget 
is apportioned among the mem-
bers on the basis of the general 
economic level and capacity of 
each. The United States presently 
contributes 25 percent of the 
money needed to support the 
organization, whereas the third 
world nations together pay only 
eight percent of the total UN 
budget. 

According to the UN charter, 
however, all members have equal 
rights and votes. So when issues 
arise that concern the developing 
nations, they have enough votes to 
constitute a majority. This voting

denial of this s~l1ed "tyranny" economic order, the first world

discussion. cessions, but not those that would

this resolution outraged the lecture, Jaipal clarified the aim of

Jaipal defended the third world 
voting bloc, however, arguing that 
it is " quite wrong to refer to it as 
the 'tyranny of the majority,' as 
the developing nations have ' the 
votes but not the power. " He did 
not elaborate on this point. 

A Better Deal-

Jaipal went on to say that what 
the third world countries really 
want is "a better deal from the 
Western world." Emphasizing the 
need for a new international 
economic order, he stressed that 
the underdeveloped nations are 
merely seeking to attain a certain

plained. " We simply don't have 
the capital." Instead, an adap-
tation of modern technology is 
desired for the development of the 
unindustrialized nations.

community to tape events, speakers, meetings, or make documen-
taries or sportcasts. 

evc also teaches community members to do the programs them-
selves. Channel 24 has classes in \02" video production, makes %" 
equipment available for a low charge, and then cablecasts the 
programs made. 

No Charge For CablecasUng 
If anyone in the community cannot get Channel 24 at home, eve 

prOVides a viewing center at their office that people can use by ap-
pointment. To use the equipment, people must take a four day 
production class, or demonstrate an ability to correctly use the 
equipment. There is a small rental fee to use equipment, but no charge 
for cablecasting the programs_ 

Public access cable TV is slowly responding to local needs and 
desires ; it could forseeably be the means for opening new lines of 
communication_ " Hot" community disputes could be negotiated by 
the preparation of reasoned positions for transmission by cable_ In this 
way, public participation in political events and meetings could be 
increased by direct cablecast.

" I want to prove that it (quality 
ratings) can be done and that 
reliable ratings can be obtained," 
continued Russo. 

If he is successful, Russo hopes 

to go on with further experiments 
to prove consumers will use Such

The success of the study depends 
on large numbers of volunteer 
tasters. "Everyone on campus is 
invited to participate and can 
participate as many times as they 
want," Russo said.

91-83 Victory 

Tritons Stay in Conference Race 
UC San Diego stayed in the 

conference basketball race with a 
91-& victory at Point Lorna College 
Friday night. 

The Tritons upped their NAJA 
District 3 Southern Division ma.rk 
to 1-2, a half game ahead of POI~t 
Lorna which standS at 1-3. The Win 
seem~d surprisingly easy over the 
Crusaders, which had lost by just 
10, 107-97, to top-ranked Cal Baptist 
Tuesday night. 

UCSD, 8-10 for the season, trails 
only USIU and Azusa Pacific in the 
race for second place, and a 
probable NAIA play-off spot. 

"We hadn't been able to sustain 
40 full minutes of intensity for a 
long time_ We finally put 
something together for the whole 
game," said a pleased Cun-

Game and 
Outcome 

byRon Kato 
Staff Writer 

Earlier in the evening, UCSD's 
junior varsity team was much less 
fortunate than their varsity 
counterparts, as they lost to Pt. 
Lorna in a lopsided battle, 102~. 

Hampered by the tendency to 
commit personal fouls, the Tritons 
were cited on 31 different oc-
casions, allowing the Crusaders to 
score on 26 out of 40 attempts from 
the free th row line. 

HElP SELECT THE 
STUDENT REGENT 

Despite shooting the mediocre 65 
percent from the Ii ne, the 
Crusaders converted on 38 out of 72 
attempts (52.8 percent ) from the 
field. The Tritons however, putting 
up a near equal 70 shots were able 
to tally oh only 28 occasions for a 
mere 40 percent shooting average. Applications are now being taken for one 

under-graduate to serve on a regional 
nominating commission to screen applicants 

for the student regent. 
Pick up applications in the Student Center, 
2nd Floor North, Student Organizations.

Led by 6'8" center Ted Ander-
son's 25 points, Pt_ Lorna had five 
short scoring bursts of eight, 
Seven, seven, seven and 10 while 
holding the Tritons scoreless to 
pull away to their sixth win in 10 
games. Consistent play from 
UCSD's Rich Robinson and Scott 
Stone vi rtually went unnoticed 
amidst the fouls and turnovers 
hampering the team as the Tritons 
fell behind 51-32 at half. 

Tempers began flaring on the 
UCSD team early in the second 
half as the frustrated Tritons fell 
behind by as much as 33 points. 
Reserve Cary ThompsQn's 10 
points with less than I() minutes 
remaining in the game did not 
close the margin as the Crusader's 
offense countered equally. Other 
high scorers for the Tritons were 
Stone with 10 points, Doug Hafford 
with nine and J oe Greenstein with 
eight. 

In losing 102~3 , it was the second 
straight game the junior varsity 
squad yielded over a 100 points to 
their opponents_ The Tritons are 
now posting a 2~ record.

Notebook 

by Dave Eisen 
Sports editor 

Ping Pong Takeover 
Very quietly, UC San Diego is 

being taken over by ping-pong. 
Officially, the game is called 

. table tennis, but by whatever 
name, the sport is becoming one of 
the most popular on campus. 
There is hardly a moment when 
some ping-pong afficianado isn't in 
one of the rec gym rooms having a 
battle. 

The latest news comes from Ross 
Bott, who heads the UCSD table 
tennis club. He announced that the 
first annual UCSD Table Tennis 
Championships will be held during 
the week of Feb. 2~. The Czar 

There will be an open and a novice division, with the winners, along 
with the top women and faculty person winning a prize_ Both divisions 
will be played double elimination style. 

Bott says that the top open performers will get a chance to join the 
UCSD table tennis team. The team has its first match against the San 
Diego Table Tennis Club Jan. 28 at Balboa Park . . 

Finally, Bott reminds us, his club meets Mondays and Wednesdays at 4 
a nd Fridays at noon, in the rec gym. He adus that sign-ups for the 
tourney are in the rec gym office, beginning today. The entry fee is 50 
cents. 

It 's certainly a small price to pay to be involved in the takeover of UCSD __ _ 
Triton basketball analysis __ .!t appears the team is beginning, as 

coaches like to say, to gel. The key is still quickness, which the squad had 
tons of in the win over Point Lorna. 

Bart Bradley, the junior guard, has developed his outside shot to the 
point of being quite dangerous_ He put in eight of 10 bombs Friday night. 
He, along with an improving Lyle Smith, the always strong Mark 
Dobransky, an emerging Lee Gardner, the spark of Ken Melvin, the 
hustle of Doug Skidmore, the experience of Tony Moore, the rest of the 
s ubstitutes, and Mallory Mitchell, form a very representative team. 

A 7-3 league record could put the Tritons into the NAJA play-off picture. 
That would mean a pair of wins against the rivals, USIU, later in the 
season .. _ 

He calls himself, for an unknown reason, The Basketball Czar. 
Everyone else knows him as Mike Hipp, the assistant intrilmural 
director. 

" We have over 130 teams and 1300 participants in intramurals this 
quarter, " the Czar figures. " The whole school seems to be getting into the 
program." 

Hipp, along with his other duties, heads the " big" sport of each quarter. 
, This time around, it's basketball. Due to his leadership, possibly, the 
gyms are almost always filled with basketball stars_ 

" We're also trying to start a women 's basktball league, the fi rst in 
UCSD's his tory. The captain's meeting is Thursday at 4 in the rec gym ~ 
conference room. By the way," said the Czar, " you can credit the idea to 
a woman named Sherri Swanson." 

Oh ... 
For two tickets to any event that I choose, name the last team that 

defeated UCSD's football team, just before it folded ... 
Freshman Jeff Siegel and sophomore Paul Friedman head the effort to 

put together a UCSD sports car club. 

" We're trying to get more students, faculty, and staff who are in-
terested in cars," said Siegel. "We'd like to get more people, so we can 
compete in slaloms, get discounts on parts, and generally learn more 
a bout sports cars." 

In the pros ... the Mariners meet Phoenix tomorrow night, Calgary 
Thursday night, and Cleveland Saturday nighLDetails will be pre-
sented here next week on both the Andy Williams San Diego Open golf 
tourney, and the San Diego Indoor track meeL.

equalization of all state incomes, 
not just the salaries of state 
workers. 

Other proposals favorable to the 
UPC include closing loopholes 
which allow wealthy persons and 
corporations to pay little or no 
taxes and making the state income 
tax more progressive with Â· the 
introduction of a negative income 
tax. Negative income tax would 
require the state to rebate past 
taxes to Californians who are 
unemployed or whose incomes fall 
below the poverty level.

Want to be a Delegate? 
Steps to Take Outlined 

by Sara Lowen 
Community Editor 

"You don't have to be a political veteran to become a delegate. You just 
have to get people to support you at the caucus," said Sue Reno of the San 
Diego County Democratic Committee. 

According to the committee, there are two basic steps to becoming a 
delegate. The first step is becoming involved in a presidential campaign. 

The second step is to follow the procedures established under the new 
Presidential primary law. The procedures entail filing a declaration of 
candidacy as a delegate with the County Clerk by April 8 and attending 
congressional caucuses beginning April 11 . 

Uncommitted delegations may qualify for the June primary ballot by 
obtaining the signatures of 1 percent of the State's Democrats by March 
15. 

, Right to Reject 
Each congressional caucus will nominate 10 delegates to the state 

steering committee, with delegates ranked according to the number of 
votes they received in the caucus election. Under the new law, candidates 
have the right to reject and replace delegates nominated at the caucuses. 
The number of delegates for each candidate who attend the Democratic 

National Convention will be determined by the percentage of the vote that 
the candidates receive in the June 8 primary. Candidates must receive at 
least 10 percent of the vote to receive any delegates. 

Apportioning delegates according to the vote percentage candidate 
receives in the primary constitutes a major change from the winner-take-
all primaries of 1972, in which the candidate who won a state primary got 
all of the state's delegates. 

"The new law will allow for a truly open primary," Reno said. "The 
winner-take-all system was just not fair." 

Widespread Participation Encourged 
Reno said that the Democratic Party will encourage and participation 

of minorities, women and young people in the convention as it did in 1972. 
Though the party does not have a quota system for minority and female 
delegates, Reno said that the 75-25 system for selecting delegates will 
insure that women and minorities participate in the convention. 

In that system, 75 percent of the delegates are chosen in congressional 
caucuses and 25 percent are chosen in statewide caucuses after the 
primary, allowing the party to balance women and minority represen-
tation on the delegations if they are not adequately represented through 
the congressional caucus process. 

"The effects of the new primary law and the work of the Affirmative 
Action committee should insure that a lot of people very new to politics 
will attend the convention this year," Reno said.
