In September of last year. a 
committee of (TCSt) faculity 
.... ubmitted a report to 
Chancellor Richard Atkinson 
concerning the establishment 
of a la\\ school at lICSD, Thi<; 
commlltec \\<lS chaIred bv Dr 
Herbert York of the PolitICal 
Science Department: the 
report is often referred to as 
the York Report. 

The committee presented 
the fact that 111 Northern 
CalIfornia there are three 
public la\, .. schools. whIle in 
Southern California there is 
only one public law school at 
L'CLA, One of the many 
findings of the committee \\as 
that a la\\ school \\'ould 
pro\ide a "source of

Rape is not a political issue. 
Rape is a violent criminal act. 
The men on the AS Council 
don't understand this, and 
they won't because they can 
wal k on campus alone at nigh l. 

Advocates of the Cali/umia 
RellicLI' defend their POSIt ion on 
grounds of "f r eedo m of 
speech" and "eq ual represen· 
ta tion ." On both , they are 
obscuring the real issue, 
which is: Should UCSD 
students pay for a ne\V ~J1ajJer 
glorifying gang rape?

Anyone who \\ ants t o can 
~tart 'a newsppaer. But l llSJ) 
students aren't obligated to 
support, or pay for , every 
supporter of criminal acts. 
The AS Council, and students, 
need to draw a line bet ween 
funding polil ical ideas and 
funding supporters of gang 
rape, and they should. dra\\' 
that line with the Call/Urlllil 
Hl'l'ieU' . 

Rape is not a liberal vs. 
conservat ive issue. Rape is not 
a free speech issue. Hape is not 
an issue at all. Rape is a \ iolent 
crime. Anvone who even 
jokingly or remotely ~upports 
rape is also guilty. A majority 
of the counci I has condoned 
those who glorify rape . The 
st udents have a c hoice: to vote 

no on a referendum 
regarding AS funding of the 
Cali/urllia Hl'I' ieU', or to 
support t hose who su pport 
rape.

We feel that s tudents at this 
universit y have got ten ou t of 
control with their midweek 
partying. It is fine to drink a 
few beers if vou are able to 
ha ndle them ' in add ition to 
you r school work. We feel that 
Chuck WIlson of Third College 
is a perfect cxample of a 
st udent who can't handle 
himself. Last Wednesda), 
Chuck performed a techni· 
color yaw n off the se\'enth 
floor of Tioga Ha ll at 2::lO am 

because he reltnquish<..>d his 
res ponsibilities and could not 
handle his alcohol. We hope 
such activities will not happen 
again due to the fact that they 
are grolesq ue . We hope 
everyone will learn from thIS 
example of being a light weight 
and \\ill modera te their 
midweek part y ing. By the

UCSD Employees Debate Losses, 
Benefits of Union Representation 

By JANE GALBRAITH 
Staff Writer 

A many UCSD students 
take final examinations next 
week, nearly 5,000 UCSD 
employees will be awaiting the 
results of the union elections 
cu rrently in progress. In line 
with their responsibilities 
under the Higher Education 
Employer/ Employee Act of 
1978, the Public Employment 

l~ elation s Board (PERE) has 
scheduled these elections to 
determine if employees in 
specific classificatiom,; in the 
nine campus UC system want 
union representation. 

The election includes seven 
employee bargaining units as 
determined by PERB. These 
unit s include clerical and 
a lli ed. service, libra rians. 
technical. patient care 
professional. patient care 
technical. and registen:d 
nurse. Th ese units are 

comprised of a total of 4.760 
UCSD employees and 38,400 
employees systemwide. 

La s t week the afore 
mentioned employees received 
ballots list ing their voting 
options. The Ca lifornia 
Nurses Association and the 
American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal 
Employees (AFSCME) will bid 
for the nurses unit. The 
America n Federa tion of 
Teachers will contest for the 
librarians unit. The remaining 
units can choose between the 
AFSCME and "no representa· 
tion." [n addition, all units will 
be gi\'en a "no repre~entation" 
option, The winnlllg optiun 
must recei\'e a majorit) \ote.

not achieved a run ·offeiection

Sweet bl'came the first woman 
In the countr\' to hold such a 
positIOn as c)\'erseer of both 
men's and women 's athletics. 
She admits that It was 
difficult at times because of 
some feeli ngs on the part of 
athletes and administrators 
that she was invading " ma le 
territory." he is happy that 
feelings have changed. This is 
probably in part due to her 
competence at the job. 

Anotl-rer source of happiness 
for her is the succesful growth 
of the program in the past 
three of four years, with 
regard to participants and 
general support from the 
student body. Several of the 
intercollegiate team have 
been successful nationally and 
she feels this is a great source 
of pride for the university. She 
is becoming happier with the 
program as time progresses. 
There are always obstacles to 
overcome. however, and a 
major one here is the high 
turnover rate among the 
coaching staff. Recruiting and

would prefer to s pend 
elsewhere. 

In what free time she does 
have, Sweet likes to jog for 
recreation and for health . She 
likes to read and she enjoys 
working with stained glass, 
making windows for her own 
home and for friends. She is 
also a member of the "Flying

team and teaches tennis and 
badminton in the PE 
Department. She did her 
undergraduate work at the

master's degree of sciences 
from the University of 
Arizona, and a master's in 
busines administration from 
National University. She 
taught at Tulane University 
and the University of Arizona 
before coming to UCSD ten 
years ago. Basically, Judy 
Sweet is a very accomplished 
and ambitious woman who, 
even after eight years at the

admits that "sometimes the 
job is fun. "

Running Thoughts 
By JEFF SAVt\GE and MIKE GIlEENBERG 

Siaff 'v\ l'ile" 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE DEPT. Earlier thi s year, we 
spoke of the inordina te success of t he Philadelphia sports t eam~. 
This was before the 76ers won the NRA championship - so we 
can add them to the list of Philly champions, which includes the 
Eagles, who made it to the Super Bowl in 'ti l , and the Philli s, 
who won the World Series in '80. The ilL Flye rs also seem to be 
there every year. But wait. There's a new kid on the block . The 
Philadelphia Stars of the USFL sport the best record in the 
league, and by defeating the powerful Michigan Panthers 
Sunday, have clinched the fir st spot in the playoffs, Kelvin 
Bryant and Co. have the Philadelphia fans pleased once more, 
and it' s getting to the point where Philadelphians have become 
rather spoiled . Even heavyweight champion Larry Holmes hails 
from the Philadelphia area. The economy of Pennsy lvania is poor 
but we see a way to give it a boost in the arm . Perhaps the s tate 
could undertake a bus iness and rent out one of its successful 
sports teams to success·hungry cities. There sure are a lot of 
them around. Both success hungry cities and success ful 
Philadelphia sport teams, that is. 
NOT TO BE BELIEVED DEPT, From a Sports /lfus/rated 
interview with Boston Red Sox Manager Ralph Houk: "Once 
when I wa ' pla ying minor league ball in Joplin (Mo.) I claimed I 
was hit by a pit ch even though I wasn'l. While everyone was 
arguing, I bit myself on the arm and su re enough. the umpire 
gave me the base." 
WAIT A MINUTE DEPT. Mani~ Frazier ~cored a ten 
round deCIS ion over Joe Bugner Saturday in a heavyweight bout 
III AtlantIC City , NJ. That's no big deal: after all. Frazier is qUick 
at age 22, and Bugner is s low at age :l:t But the interesting t hmg 
is that Bug-ner. the former British and European champion. lost 
a 12 round decision ten years ago to a gU\' named Smokm Joe 
FrazH.'r. Smokm' joe. of course. IS the fattier of Man I .... 
QUOTES EXTRAOHDINAIRE DEPT. Angel firsl 
baseman Rod Can.' \\ IS stili hit t ing an incredible . 110. and e\ ('n if 
he went ().for·tl:l he would stili be hilling .JOO. ,\lan Bannlsterol

..;ide..; of the story in the last 
few weeks. "r received 
newslellers almost everyday. 
The newsletters could be

example, claiming that If your

union. The union claims that

know who IS right."

stated, " I don't think the union
