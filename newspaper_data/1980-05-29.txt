New Field Named for 
Late Trainer Pryatel 

A new playing field at 
UCSD wilr be dedicated 
Tuesday, June 10, in honor of 
Charles J. Pryatel, equipment 
manager and trainer for 
intercollegiate athletics at the 
k:hool for eight and a half 
years. 

The ceremony will be held 
at 1 pm on the field, located 
north of Old Miramar Road 
and east of the Central 
University Library. 

Pyratel was a staff member 
in the physical education 
department from July 1-969 
until his death on December 6, 
1977. In addition to his duties 
as equipment manager and 
trainer, Pryatel assisted in the 

development of the cross· 
country track and other 
outside facilities , and designed 
and built inside court 
equipment to aid in class 
instruction. 

In June 1972, Pryatel 
suffered a massive coronary 
but returned to full· time work 
five months later and began a 
program of physical activities 
under the consultation of the 
department. 

Dr. Ted Forbes, physical 
education supervisor and 
former chairman of the 
department, said Pryatel 
served as an excellent model 
for UCSD students. 

KSDT Budget Decision 
Delayed Until Saturday 

AS Also Haggles Over Activity Fee 
BY JENIFER WARREN 

Anociate N_. Editor 
A handful of KSDT staff 

members waited more than 
three hours at last night's 
Associated Students meeting 
to voice their opposition to a 
proposal calling for the 
elimination of AS funding for 
the radio station, only to see 
the council table the issue for 
discussion at AS Orientation 
this Saturday. 

The proposed AS Execu-
tive Budget , released 
yesterday reflects expected 
cuts in areas such as student 
organizations, SCURI and 
commissioners' budgets. It 
also shows the surprise 
omission of funding for KSDT, 
which in the past has received 
money from the AS Wlder its 
Communications/Media Bo· 
ard heading. 

" I ha ve serious concerns 
over the viability of KSDT," 
said AS President Jeremy 
Charlton at last night 's 
meeting. "No one on campus 
can hear it and they haven't 
gotten it together for 12 
years." 

In a brief statement 
permitted after the Council 
decided to postpone budget 
discussion , KSDT Program 
Director Dave Revel outlined 
the station's stituation last 
night. 

"We've got to have a 
$10,000 operating budget to 
keep our doors open," he 
claimed, "or we won't be a 
viable student media. " 

"KSDT serves students and 
is striving to serve students as 
effectively as any of the 
printed media on campus," he 
said. "We're trying to improve 
our listenability on campus 10 
we can get more student input 
into our station." 

Revel added that KSDT 
provides members of "the 
university community with an 
excellent opportunity to learn 
.about the music industry and 
broadcasting." 

Council response to Revel's 
testimony was sparse, with 
External Affairs Commis· 
sioner Warren Wheeler 
voicing the only comment. 

"We should think hard 
about cutting off a media 
source that can be the most 
effective information lOurce 
for students on campus," he 
warned the council. 

KSDT supporters agreed, 
urging the AS to "visit the 
station, see what goes on and 
see how hard we're working to 
serve students before you 
make a decision." 

The council will vote on the 
proposed budget at next 
Wednesday's meeting. 

In other AS business: 
- The council voted 17·2 

to appoint to the Student 
Center Board one representa-
tive from both the Student 
Affirmative Action Commit-
tee and the Co-ops and 
Enterprises. 

" It's imperative that we 
have someone from SAAC on 

the Student Center Board," 
said AS member Marsha 
Vdovin, who labeled the board 
"predominantly white and 
male." 

Yet cOWlal member Pam 
Gerber argued that a "SAAC 
representative would merely 
be a token," and should 
remain a non.voting member. 

KSDT Outraged by 
Budget Omission 

BY ALICE ROCKEY 
Staff Writer 

The mood at radio station KSDT yesterday was angry. 
"This really sucks," KSDT General Manager Kevin Rockwell 

said yesterday in response to Jeremy Charlton's 
recommendation to the AS to cut all funding for KSDT in the 
upcoming fiscal year. (See story above.) 

" I fully anticipated at least an operating budget," he said. 
KSDT's budget request does not appear on the proposal to be 
considered by the AS. 

In past years, the AS has funded KSDT under its 
Communications/Media Board heading. This year, Charlton 
has placed KSDT as an item for consideration along with such 
organizations as SCURI and CASINO but has made no 
recommendations to the AS to consider KSDT's budget request. 

KSDT has asked for approximately $10,000 for operating 
costs and $10,000 for new equipment. But Charlton said the 
station is not "viable. " "Nobody listens to KSDT on campus," he 
said. 

KSDT is requesting money for equipment that will inclue a 
carrier current system for on·campus broadcasting. This system 
costs between $3,000 and $4,500 according to Rockwell. 

"We also want to upgrade the system at KSDT. W e need new 
turntables, a broadcast board a nd tape decks," he said. Their 
budget proposal notes that this will provide better sound to its 
audience and save on repair costs to their old, outdated systems. 

Subsidy for a sales manager is also part of KSDT's request for 
AS funding. "That position should be a key figure in raising 
money for KSDT," said Rockwell. 

Working primarily on promoting KSDT and selling 
advertising space on the air, the sales manager would help 
KSDT achieve independence from the AS budget. 

" I'd like to see KSDT separating from the AS funding 
system," said Scott Elisberg, KSDT chief engineer. "We've 
always had to scratch and beg for every penny." 

Charlton justifies rejecting KSDT's budget request because 
only "a small percentage of students are served and the quality 
. " IS poor. 

The station's range currently extends down to the border, out 
to EI Cajon and north to Rancho Santa Fe. The new carrier 
current system would make KSDT available to students in the 
dorms. Please tum to page 8

Long, Long Ago, in a Galaxy -
Far, Far Away ... 'Earth Wars' 

BY JOHN MARKOFF 
SUNNYVALE, CA. - A 
windowlesl blue three.story 
cement building set next to a 
Ir_ay in thil San Francilco 
suburb is the command center 
for the newest I...anch of the 
US armed forces. 

Marked only by two 
maaaive antennas pointing 
skyward, and referred to 8B the 
"blue zoo" by aornr: of the men 
who work inlide, the US 
Satellite Control Facility is the 
operational command center 
for the Space Division of the 
US Air Force, established last 
year. 

The center is a key link in a 
new US push to develop the 
capability to fight a war in 
outer space. It is the nerve 
center of a worldwide network 
of tracking stations that allow 
the Air Force to control the 
hundreds of military satellites 
used for communication, 
navigation, intelligence 
gathering and early warning of 
potential Soviet missile 
attacks. 

The Control Facility has 
gained importance because 
both the United States and the 
Soviet Union are rapidly 
accelerating military activity 
in space in the wake of the twin 
crises in Afghanistan and Iran 
and the consequent stalling of 
the Strategic Arms Limitation 
Talkl (SALT) agreement. 

"Space is the high ground in 
today'l world," says General 
Richard Henry, the man who 
commands the nation'l space 
forcel. 

The US has sought higher 
ground following the 10" of

of the Iranian revolution. In

the past, sensitive spying 
equipment that the US had 
stationed along Iran's border 
with the Soviet Union 
permitted t.he military to keep 
tab. on missile tests taking 
place deep inside Soviet 
territory. 

Since the losl of these 
stations the US has been 
forced to rely more heavily on 
"ferret" satellites which g: .:her 
photographic and electronic 
intelligence from orbit and 
then relay it back to the 
Satellite Control Facility. 

The center is a 
key link in a new 
US push to develop 
the capability to 
fight a war in 
space. 

Although satellite intelli· 
gence collection is protected 
by existing SALT agree· 
ments, defense experts are 
concerned that any war 
between the United States and 
the Soviet Union would 
probably begin with elforts to 
knock out the opponent's spy 
satellites. Without the 
intelligence that such satellites 
provide, the United States 
would be virtually paralyzed in 
a war situation . 

Both countries have been 
spending increasingly larger 
portions of their military 
budgets on space related 
sYltems (the US spent $4. 1 
billion last year) and this new 
arena for the armll race is apt 
to prove far more costly than 
anything that has been spent 
on earth·based weaponll to 
date.

race in space is breaking down 
is the recent anti· satellite test 
conducted by the Soviet 
Union. The test, which began 
April 3, ended a two-year 
moratorium during which the 
US and the Soviets carried out 
negotiations aimed at banning 
satellite weapons Irom space. 

US officials announced 
recently that the Soviets had 
launched an anti·satellite 
target vehicle, called Cosmos 
117. A short time later a 
Soviet "hunter· killer" sat elite 
was launched which 
completed a rendezvous with 
the target satellite, although it 
was not detonated as other 
killer satellites have been in the 
past. 

Defense officials said the 
killer satellite is designed to 
enter the same orbit as the 
target satellites and then close 
in to within several hundred 
yards. The killer satellite is 
then exploded, sending 
thousands of pieces of 
shrapnel to destroy the target. 

Now that the Soviets have 
resumed their testing of space 
weapons, the US is certain to 
follow. The Air Force has 
awarded a $58 million 
contract to the Vought 
corporation to develop a 
"direct ascent" satellite killer 
which will be carried under the 
wing of an F·lS fighter 
aircraft. The Vought hunter· 
killer is designed to seek out an 
enemy satellite with an 
inlrared homing device and 
then collide with it. 

American tests are 
scheduled to begin this year 
and the weapon will probably 
be deployed beginning in 
1983. Because the American 
killer .atellite will be carried by 
the F -15, it is believed it will be 
more flexible than the Soviet 
'Yltem since US aircraft are 
deeloyable around the world. 

Beside.8 the killer satellite 
research, both the United 
States and the Soviets are allo 
developing particle beam and 
laser weaponl for ule againlt 
latellites. An American 
intelligence report sent to the 
Prelident in mid.May claim. 
that the Sovieh have 
lucceufully developed a 
ground· based laser weapon 
that may be effective againlt

latel~tes. The report also 
c1aiml the Soviets may be able 
to deploy a Ipace·based laser 
weapon effective again.t

1980 •.

c·etter 
Punch 'n ~ Judy War? 
Editor: 

The government has been speaking of war for a number of 
months now. In February, they and a number of ostensibly 
responsible news commentators very casually mentioned the 
inevitability of nuclear weapons exchange (one does not speak 
of destroying people and cities, one merely exchanges nuclear 
weapons) in the event of a Soviet assault beyond Afghanistan. 
Even Mr. Carter threatened to use force to defend the oil 
producing nations. This would even include Iran, a nation our 
president has repeatedly scolded and spanked with Irequently 
embarrassing results . 

Now , reportedly on May 28, the Senate will very likely 
approve funds to reactivate the Selective Service system. I 
personally do not object to a peacetime draft. I vehemently 
object to war. Contextually, it seems eminently obvious to me 
that the draft is being reinstated as a threat of military action 
against the USSR. It is not unreasonable to view this as several 
long steps on the not so long path to war. 

Why is this war being spoken of so freely , so recklessly? How 
will our nation or the world benefit from the war? These 
questions have not been addressed in more than the vaguest 
pedestrian terms, such as the current bastardizations of the noble 
notions of "patriotism," "freedom" and " human rights." 

By and large, observers agree that a theatre nuclear was (sort 
of a Punch and Judy show where, let's say, Iran and Saudi 
Arabia blast each other under the direct control of the USSR and 
the US) has an overwhelmingly high chance of escalating into an 
absurd Dullesian massive exchange between the two senior 
members of the ICBM dub, and perhaps even with the 
somewhat dim·witted junior member (still rather new to the 
game). 

Well, by golly gosh: 
- Big Navy bases are prime targets, and probably would 

have several warheads of megaton strength aimed at them to 
insure at least one successful penetration. This sort of warhead 
would cause total physical destruction to an approximately 15 
mile radius from ground zero if detonated at the proper altitude. 

- Guess what city is the biggest naval station on the west 
coast. That's right. No more Black's Beach. No more Del Mar. 
No more La Jolla. No more UCSD. 

The hourly indicator on the gym step. featured a report of 
several thousand American marines landing in Oman, 
coincidentally, on the day Carter was unable to attend Tito's 
funeral while nearly every leader in the civilized world made a 
point of attending. 

I don't want a war. What can I do? There is a rally on 
Thursday. I'm going to attend if only to add bulk to the crowd. 
We, the educated, the scientists, artists, technicians, lawyers, 
doctors, mothers, fathers , must show that we don 't agree that a 
war is obviously necessary. Perhaps our government might be 
forced to clarify their reasons for wanting a war. They'd better be 
good, and they'd better not be petty emotional appeals.

Iran Militants Wam 
Of Hostage Trials 

IRAN - Iranian militants 
warned yesterday that the 53 
American hostages will be 
"tried and punished" unless 
the deposed shah is returned 
with his riches from Egypt. 
Their latest threat coincided 
with the opening session 01 the 

. new Iranian Parliament which 
is to decide the late of the 
hostages. 

The Parliament heard 
Iranian revolutionary leader, 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho· 
meini, recommend "a policy 01 
neither East nor West" and 
Iranian President Abolhassan 
Bani·Sadr warn 01 economic 
hardships . 

But neither Khomeini nor 
Bani·Sadr mentioned the 
hostage.s, who spent their 
207th day in captivity - and 
Austrian Chancellor Bruno 
Kreisky said in Athens, 
Greece, he thought there was 
only "a fair chance that the 
hostages will be released 
sooner or later." 

Kreisky, recently returned 
from meetings in Tehran with 

Iranian leaders, said Iran "is 
not ready to give in to any kind 
of pressure. " And in 
Washington, State Depart. 
ment Thomas Reston said the 
Carter administration would 
await Iranian reaction to the 
World Court decision ordering 
the hostages ' release before 
taking its case for sanctions 
back to the United Nations. 
Iran has already called the 
World Court deci sion 

"meanin~les 5." 
In a statement broadcast 

yesterday over Tehran Radio, 
the militants urged Parliament 
to ignore pleas from the "great 
satan," the United States. 

The militants, who seized 
the hostages after taking over 
the US Embassy in Tehran 
last Nov. 4, said the Iranian 
people supported their 
demand for the return of the 
shah as a condition for the 
hostages' release and said 
"any other decision" by 
Parliament would require 
approval by the nation.

'Star Wars' Sequel 
Box Office Winner 
HOLLYWOOD (AP) - The Empire Strikes Back is 

pulling in huge audiences and is seriously challenging the 
box office championship of itll parent, Star Wars , 20th 
Century·f ox ,aid yesterday. 

During the firat week, the swashbuckling space epic 
groued $9,601,374 at 126 theaters, said Peter Myers , 
senior Fox vice president for domestic distribution. At its 
opening last Wednesday the film broke 125 house records 
for box office receipt.. 

S.ar War. has grolled more than $300 million since ita 
release three yean ago, and is the a11·time biggest movie 
moneymaker. 

II is difficult to make direct comparisons between The 
Empire Strkes &ck and S.ar Wars because the sequel 
opened in far more theaters and at higher tick!!t prices. 
M)'ers 58id that after making allowances for these 
diHerencea The Empire is running ahead of the box office 
fitures for S.ar War •. 

"The remarkable thing is that the average i, $76,202 per 
theater," said Myers. "fhat's like an a11·time record." 

Fox financed S.ar Wars and received the lion' .. hare of ita 
profita. It wiJI receive only a distribution fee for The Empire. 

Creator Georse Lucas used money from his share of S.ar 
Wars, estimated at $50 million, to pay for The Empire. If 
the movie continues at ita present rate, Lucas' profita could 
exceed $100 million.

Nixon Tapes Made Public 
WASHINGTON (AP)-

At 9 :10 EDT yesterday, 22 
reporters and 11 members of 
the public donned earphones 
and heard Richard M. Nixon 
say: "Hi, Phil, how are you? 
Sorry to keep you waiting." 

They were listening to the 
first of 31 Watergate tape 
recordings made available to 
the public for the first time at ' 
the National Archives, the 
nation's storehouse of records. 
Only a handful of members of 
the public waited in the early 

, morning hours to be among 
the fint to hear the tapes -
previou.ly listened to only by 
government officials, 
prosecutor. and jurors and 
other. who attended the two 
trial. of Nixon's associates in 
the long, evolving scandal 
known as Watergate. 

Only 121/2 hours of 6 ,000 
hour. of conversations 
secretly recorded by Nixon 
were made available because 
Nixon is fighting in court to 
keep the archives from 
allowing the public to listen in 
on the rest of his tapes. He 
argues that his own privacy 

and the right of the presidency 
were at stake. 
. Th e fir st ta pe played 
here yes terday was one used in 
the trial of John B. Connally, 

Nixon's treasu ry secretary, 
who was acquitted on charges 
of accepting illegal payments 
from a milk produce rs' 
coopera tive.

A memorial service will be 

held today for Beverly Bolton, 
former business manager at 
Muir College, who died of 
heart failure Tuesday. 

The service wiD be at 4 pm 
at the University Lutheran 

Church, on the corner of 
Torrey Pines Road and La

Bolton worked at UCSD for 
12 years, and was business 
manager at Muir for two 
years.

Stressful Rites of Spring Finals Here 
'Relax When You Study' 
A spring ritual is unfolding 

on college campuses across 
the country. It is the frantic 
and slressful rite of spring 
finala. 

According to Dr. Hugh 
Pates, counseling psychologist 
at Revelle College, many 
lIudenl feel that they need 10 
be anxioul in order to ltudy. 

refreshed. 
- Study in groups when 

possible . Group study 
provides an exchange of 
energy, often calms students, 
enables them to think better 
and provides mutual support. 

Student Counselin g and 
Psychologic a l Services 
maintains an emergency 
phone line. Their number 15 
452-3755. The service IS 
open from 8 am to 5 pm. 

This type of school-related 
lIress il a habit formed in high 
school year •. "They may have 
had good results with this 
pattern in the palt and so it 
becomel a repositive force in 
their lives," he says. 

,lOther ltudents, however, 
do not get good results from 
their lire.. habit. For these 
atudents anxiety becomes 10 
fierce that their ability to take 
tests is impaired. 

Weather Typical but Unpleasant 

" Relearch I how. that 
highly anxious ltudents have 
lower grade. overall. So, while 
anxiety has its good lide it alao 
had its down and difficult 
Iide," Pates "YI. 

Patel offerl these 
IUllestiona to .tudents coping 
Wllh school related anxiety: 

- . Increase phy.ical 
activity. An hour to an hour 
and a half of rigoroua exercise 
a day, IUch 81 roller .kating, 
lwimming or running, helps 
relieve .lres •. 

- Allow an hour per day of 
"free" recreational reading. 
Thi. disengages Itudents from 
intense concentr ation and 
reduces their anxiety level 10 
they can retum to their studies

According 10 Dr. Jeremy has been much stronger than 
Namiaa, Scripps dimatologist usual this year. 
and founder of the Ctimate 
Re.earch Group, layer-like 
clouds, called atratul douds, 
are common in the San Diego 
area. 

Stralus c louds appear 
during the eveninga and 
dilapt>ear before noon the next 
day. While precipitation is not 
allociated with stratus clouds, 

"This causes parc~ls of air 
to rise higher and more rapidly 
than normal, " explains 
Namiaa . "This ascension 
cools the air because the 
parcels are rising to areas of 
lower pressure where they 
expand and push ambient air 
aside."

threshhold value, clouds form 
and release latent heat of 
condensation. This heat is 
released when water vapor 
condenses into water, 
warming the parcel of air and 
making it more bouyant. As a 
result, air rises quickly and 
forms large cumulus douds, 
which typically rise to about 
20,000 feet above the San 
Diego area. 

The lack of inversion also 

contributes to an increase in 
the momentum of surface 
winds. This increase, plus the 
blocking of the sun by cumulus 
clouds, causes the earth's 
surface to become cold. 

Namias and other scientists 
in the Climate Research group 
are particularly interested in 
long-term climatic behavior. 

Over the last five years 
there have been encouraging 
results from a ttempts to 
predict this natural scheme.

Charlton's recommendation. 
" It 's very important that 
students in communications 
and video at UCSD be able 
to work in radio," said Jodi 
Sandven, next year's general 
manager. "We want to 
become self.sufficient, and 
need at least an operating 
budget to continue working 
toward that goal." 

Rockwell expreased 
resenbnent by noting that 
"we try 10 hard to put in all

viable media organization. 
This is a direct slap in the 
face towards all that effort." 

" I feel that this action is a 
direct insult to all the work 
people have done over the 
years," he added. 

When questioned about 
any action planned by KSDT 
to combat Charlton ' s 
recommendation, Rockwell 
said, "We have to rally 
around - I feel demoralized

by this negative assessment 
of our performance." 

The KSDT staffers plan 
on distributing pamphlets to 
AS voting members and 
lobbying before next week's 
budget vote. 

Possible alternate sources 
for funding at KSDT are 
public radio grants. 
sponsorship donations, fund 
raisers and advertising. 

The space KSDT 
occupies in the Student 
Center must be considered . 
"That's up to the Student
