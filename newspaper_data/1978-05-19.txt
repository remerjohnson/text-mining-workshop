Professors call tenure proces un ai 
by Steve Gould 

There's an old saying which reads, "What we don 't 
know won't hurt us." 

It seems that in the case of the tenure review 
process, professors denied tenure are being hurt by 
what they don't know - that is how the review process 
really works. 

This is the second of a three part series on 'he tenure 
review proce s of professors a' UCSD. Today's 
segment deals with the selection of Ad Hoc 
Committee members and the alleged political nature 
of tenure review. Included are remarks made by Drs. 
Will Wright. Michael Real and Robert Heifetz. 

Allegedly, the final decision does not concern 
merely evaluating a professor's research, teaching 
ability and comml,mity service but rather involves 
politics and deck stacking against certain professors. 

Ad Hoc selection 
A crucial step in tenure review is the 

recommendation made by the Ad Hoc Committee, a 
group of five individuals chosen by the Budget 
Committee to review a professor's file. These five are 
considered to have expertise in the field of the 
professor undergoing review. 

According to Dr. Robert Heifetz, a tenured 
professor of UrbaD and Rural Studies, 98 percent of 
the time, Vice-chancellor of Academic Affairs Paul 

Ii 
l'c'Sam DIeC. 

Saltman, who has final juri diction, accepts th 
recommendation of the Ad Hoc . Committee in 
deciding tenure cases. 

In a reply to questions asked of Saltman and Dr. 
George Reynolds, chairman of the Budget Committee 
(now called CAP - Committee on Academic 
Personnel), selection to the Ad Hoc Committee 
involves the following : 

The CAP recommends a slate of 10 candidates, 
giving a preferred slate and an alternate slate. Each 
member of the slate occupies a 'line', i.e ., represents 
a certain kind of expertise or generalist, so that if the 
first person named cannot serve, the second person 
named on that line is automatkally selected. 

" If neither can serve, lines are not crossed. The 
Personnel Office returns to CAP for additional names 
on those lines . The VCAA (Saltman) signs off on the 
committee since CAP is making a recommendation to 
him. 

"If there is any disagreement about prospective 
members, the VCAA returns to CAP for further 
consultation. No member is ever appointed to a 
review committee without such consultation." 

Heifetz claims 
Heifetz claimed that since confidentiality is 

employed and the names of the Ad Hoc Committee 
members are never divulged, no one would be able to 
discern if one potential Ad Hoc Committee member 

was pass d up b cause he or h sympathized with or 
disliked the professor being reviewed. 

Theoretically, Heifetz stated , two members of the 
preferred slate could be chos n to serve while three 
memb rs of the alternative slate might be selected 
without the remaining three on the preferred slate 
ever have been asked to serve. 

This apparent deck stacking, Heifetz said, " Is an 
unfair process (which) occurs or is focused at 
political or ideological biases ." 

Heifetz is well versed on the selection process, and 
in the 1972-73 academic school year, he was asked to 
serve 'on the CAP because, " I was one of the few 
tenured professors at Third College." (Heifetz came 
to UCSD from the University of Illinois with tenure.) 

However, Heifetz never attended a meeting and 
was asked to resign due to conflicting interests, 
presumably his activity in the debate on Third College 
status . 

When asked to serve on an Ad Hoc Committee, 
Heifetz declined to agree to the confidentiality clause 
(nobody is allowed to know who served on an Ad Hoc 
Committee and Heifetz disagreed with this policy) 
and has since not been asked again. 

Sliding slate 
Currently being reviewed for tenure, Dr. Michael 

Real of the Communications Program stated, "The 
tenure process employs a sliding scale."

gynecological funds 

,....." Mar 11, 1178 

by John Hondros 
Staff Writer 

The Advisory Committee on Student Fee Programs voted at a 
recent meeting to allocate $14,000 to the Student Health Services to 
subsidize gynecological and birth control services at UCSD 
according to committee student co-chair Marsha Harris. ' 

Day care funding stirs argument 
The formal agreements for the new arrangement " haven't been 

written and won't be ready until fall ," said Associate Vice-
chancellor of Student Affairs Richard Whitehill, in a separate 
interview. 

Whitehill, who also co-chairs 
the committee, explained that 
an agreement will be made 
with the campus Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology to 
use their qualified nurse 
practitioners.

Barry Hyman, day care

the per child cost at the center

Chancellor McElroy says the 
figure is over $4000. 

The university has decided

21 students arrested Friday in 
the day care protest, according . 
to Chancellor McElroy. 
However, the San Diego City

Using more Durse practi-
tioners than full time physi -
cians will be more economical, 
said Harris. 

Enough subsidy 
Fourteen thousand dollars 

will allow enough subsidy to 
offer students free gynecologi-
cal examinations, free birth 
control ' counseling and free 
examinations on a preventive 
basis, according to Whitehill . 
He said the only charge would 
be for lab tests, birth control 
devices and prescriptions. 

"Fourteen thousand dollars 
is Dot the whole cost for the 
program," said Whitehill. 
According to Harris, the new 
allocation of $14,000 will be 
added to the present $8,000 
Registration Fee allocation to 
the program for a total Reg Fee 
subsidy of $22,000. 

During the discussion at the 
meeting on the need for 
gynecological services and the 
need to keer budget costs down, 
it was noted that it would cost 
around $24-25,000 to pay the 
salaries of the nurse practi-
tioner and the counselor in the 
birth control clinic. 

In addition, Student Health 

Barry Hyman, AS -Commis-
sioner of Student WeJfare, is

Reed Alpert , a Warren 
College senior, was elected 
Triton Times Editor for 1978-79 
in a recent vote of the paper's 
staff. 

The other 10 board positions 
were chosen from a field of 23 
applicants by a vote of t! 
current Executive Board . 
Those selected were: 

-Eric Jaye, a Third College 
freshman, who will take over as 
Managing Editor. 

- Ran Anbar , a Revelle 
College senior, who will serve 
as News edi tor . 
-John Hondros , Jeffrey 

Beresford-Howe and Kevin 
Eckery who will serve as 
Associate ews editors. The 
three will assist in organizing 
the news department by editing 
copy, assigning tories and 
working on off-and-on campu 
news. 

Further choices of the board 
include: Ted Burke as Arts 
editor , Stan Honda as Photo 
editor, Karen Hunter as Sports 
editor, Barry Alfonso as Copy 
editor and Doug Campion a 
Science editor. 

At over $4000 per child the 
center would be one of the most 
expensive in the UC system. At 
$2774 it would be on par with the 
other centers in the UC system.

the no-man's land between the 
two sides, a prime target for 
every blast. 

The Advisory Committee waA 
placed squarely ia the middle of 
things - between the cons-
traints of a tight budget and the 
high feelings of day care 
advocates - by the actions of 
both McElroy and the day care 
supporters who camped out in 
the Chancellor's office. 

In fact, none of the three 
major actors in the day care 
scenario played out ov~r the 
past few weeks acted in a 
particular admirable manner. 

The student-members of the 
Advisory Committee showed 
the mo~ responsible behavior, 
by a long shot. They worked 
well under _ extremely trying 
circumstances, since they were ' 
under preSsure from their two 
roles. which often conflict: as 
guardians of the student purse-
strings, or. more mundanely, of 
Reg Fee monies, and as 
advocates of projects desired 
by students. like the Day Care 
Center. 

Yet, in the midst of this 
politically-charged situation, 
the student-members worked 
out a compromise measure that 
allows the center to operate for 
another year; impresses upon 
day care supporters the 
importance of cutting costs; 
and will give students the 
opportunity to express their 
opinions on Reg Fee funding of 
the center, through a referen-
dum next fall. 

It can't be ignored that the 
student-members participated 
in a decision to reject funding. 
then . reversed themse I ves 
under extreme, screaming 
pressure. But the decision can 
be easily understood - after 
all . there were 500 people 
present when the 21 students 
got arrested last Friday. 

So student committee mem-
~rs sta>:ed up late Sunday 
D1ght and IDlo Monday morning 
drafting a compromise that 
would get th~ approval of both 
majority of the committee 
members and day care sup-
porters . 

The other two actors in this 
little scenario - the day care 
supporters and McElroy -
didn't act nearly as admirably 
as the student-members. The 
day care supporters were 
backing a good cause. but the 
means they used didn't really 
justify the end. 

One such tactic was to try 
pressuring McElroy into over-
ruling the Advisory Commit-
tee. Usually people like those

protesting day care cutbacks 
are a180 staunch supporters of 
student control of student fees. 

Yet, when the Adviaory 
Committee - both administra-
tive and student-members -
voted to refuse Reg Fee fundiq 
for day care, the day care 
supporters asked McElroy to 
overrule the committee, to take 
control over student funds. 
(That McElroy actually does 
control student money makes 
no difference; tbe point is that 
students asked bim to exert 
direct action.) 

In addition, day care sup-
porters have played fast and 
easy with some facts . The 
petitions with 4000 student 
signatures, wbich day care 
backers pointed to continually 
in recent weeks, didn't exactly 
point out all the details involved 
with Reg Fee funding for the 
Day Care Center. 

The day care petition, in 
effect, just said tbat McElroy's 
going to cut out day care - Do 
you want that to happen? I've 
found more and more people in 
the past few days who said they 
signed the petition, but because 
they favor some form of day 
care service, not because they 
want a $25.000 Reg Fee subsidy 
for the center. . 

Furthermore. various day 
care backers have been passing 
out lies about the Triton Times. 
For instance. they have said we 
passed our pictures of the Nov., 
1975, Anti-CIA/Saxon demon-
strations to tbe police. They 
also said we receive more 
money from McElroy to print 
the weekly calendar than the 
Day Care Center receives from 
Reg Fee funds. . 

Both statements are blatant 
lies. We refused to turn over our 
photos of the demonstration. 
We receive one-third of the 
money that the-- Day Care 
Center receives . 

McElroy has also lied on 
several recent occasions. First, 
he said he would leave his 
meeting with day care support-
ers last Wednesday to go to 
lunch, then return. Instead, he 
went bome. 

Then. he said he would meet 
with tbe Advisory Committee 
Wednesday afternoon, to 
support day care supporters' 
claims. Instead, he skipped the 
meeting, and sent a statement 
saying $17,000 was too much 
Reg Fee money for day care. 
Day care backers were asking 
for $25,000. 

Moreover. McElroy tried to 
avoid any responsibility for 

(Please turn to page 7) 

McElroy's a good guy 
Recently there has been a great deal of noise made by our fellow 

students to the effect that Chancellor McElroy is an inhumane 
person wbo wants to end our day care program . It has been stated 
on flyers around campus that, "McElroy would rather arrest 
students than talk with them." There has also been a conspicuous 
lack of information publicized presenting McElroy's side of the 
issue. and on Tuesday we decided to find out what he had to say. A 
phone call and five minutes later Phil and Steve found themselves 
sitting with McElroy in his office. unhandcuffed. 

We found out that day care operates · on a budget of 
approximately $135.000. providing care (or a total of 40 children. 
Some of these children stay only part ofthe day, so that effectively 
there are 32 fulltime students. Yes students, this is not a mere 
babysitting service but a full fledged nursery school operation 
which spends approximately $90,000 of its $135.000 to staff itself. 

Last year our Chancellor took over $10,000 out of a fund which he 
controls to belp out the center. He hoped that this money would 
give the center time to seek other sources of funding, as well as to 
find ways to accommodate another 70 children on a waiting list 
who also need care. This year the center is fighting to get McElroy 
to give them a similar handout. Students are being led to believe 
that without Mc~lroy's money day care will cease to exist, despite 
the fact that Without his money the center will still have over 
$100.000 . McElroy has denied them another donation, and for good 
reasons. 

To begin with, it doesn't take an economics major to figure out 
that $4,000 per year per child is a lot of money to spend on nursery 
school. Our parents spend les than that to send us to college with 
room and board, children at the Day Care Center do not even get 
lunch. What they do receive is an extravagant brand of pre-school 
education. The new indicator describes what the day care people 

~all "quality day care" c on page 4 of the May 16-29 issue. 
Expo~ure to ~any dlffe~nt kinds of people - fat, thin, quiet, 

loquacIOUS, white, brown -IS also extremely important as regards 
staff." Day care spends approximately $90,000 a year to hire a 
sufficiently diverse staff for the amusement of four year olds. 
Sure, they've hired a very well qualified assortment of people. The 
point is that there are still 70 children on that waiting list While 
40 enjoy un~eeded luxury. It is like having 100 people who need 
transportation to school, buying 40 of them Cadillacs, and letting 
the rest walk. Day care should serve students with children. not 
provide a testing ground for visionary psychologists with 
expansive ideas on what "decent" child care should be. 

Quality day care is available, and it does not have to cost UCSD 
students, the state and federal government and other 
organizations $4.000 per year per child . But the day care people 
and the new indicator want us to believe differently. They want us 
to ~liev«: !hat McElroy is a monster, while they camp out in his 
office waltmg for a handout. The new indicator . again in the May 
16-29 issue. said that McElroy "in his 'private' life knows enough 
about decent and quality day care to place his own child in the best 
center money can buy." And he does, too. And he does it for well 
under $4.000 a year, $800, to be exact. (Please turn to page 3)

signed that petition without knowing what they were signing. 
Some of us did. Sure. that doesn 't say much for our intelligence. 
but maybe now that we have become aware of our power as a 
student body we can learn to use that power with more discretion. 
Maybe we' ll look at McElroy's side next time. before we go out and 
get arrested. So while we are still united for the cause of decent day 
car. why don't we see about getting day care for those other 70 kids 
as well. instead of funding a circus for 40 others?·

Day care furor surprising 
Editor: 

The recent furor over day care is quite surprising. I fail to understand 
why the parents seem to think they have a right to b.; subsidized by the 
students at large ("reg (ees" ) or the taxpayers ("state funds" ) . Raising 
children is admittedly an expensive responsibility and unless one is willing 
and able to support them one should not have them . In the case o( parents 
who work or are students "support" includes day care. The idea that the 
student population. the vast majority of whom do not have children, should 
be required to help pay for day care is outrageous. If the university is to 
offer day care for the children of the university community then the 
program should be entirely funded by the parents who use it.

The Gonzos of the CaUish 
League lead all intramural 
indoor soccer teams in points 
scored but still fail to hold first 
place after the sixth week of 
play. 

Sporting a 5-1 record, the 
Gonzos (not to be confused with 
double live gonzo) have 
compiled ' 36 points, 14 more 
than front-running ????? ?? ? 
(pronounce this name anyway 
you want to) . However , 
??????? is undefeated (as of 
this past Monday) with a 3-6 
mark, good for 22 points. 

?????? has allowed eight 
fewer- points ·than- the- G~os 
and has not lost a game, hence 
the top spot in the league. On 
the basis of the better record, 
the Kickers are in third place 
(2-1) with just 14 points while 
having allowed 16 points . 
Paragon follows the Kickers 
with a 2-2 mark. 

GGGC tops 
In the two AAA Leagues, the 

Sockers and the GGGC top the 
AAAI and AAAZ standings. The 
Sockers have compiled a 
perfect 3-6 slate and amassed 20 
points while letting up only 4, 
the best among all indoor 
soccer teams. 

In the Corbina League, the 
AA division, GGGC holds a slim 
margin over second place 

PK' s . Both teams have 2-1 
records but GGGC has 23 points 
while allowing 19 compared to 
the PK 's 20 points for and 

a~~ inst. 

Few games 
In the AAA division, there is 

only one league (the Perch) . It 
seems that's what the teams in 
this AA division have been 
doing - perching, because only 
two games have been contested 
QY the four competing teams. 

- The'Oysters hold a b)g.!eaCl In 
this abbreviated session with-a 
2-6 mark (17 points scored and 
only 6 allowed) . The Derelects 
have been derelect in their 
playing and ha ve not yet played 
one game . The Deltas and 
Barrels round out the bottom 
portion of the Perch League, 
both with 0-1 records . 

All indoor games are played 
on Monday nights and Saturday 
mornings in the Recreation 
Gym . Spectator space is 
extremely limited, so inter-
ested viewers should make 
ticket reservations with Lee 
Johnson at 4524037 as soon as 
possible. 

It'll blow your mind!

THE CASE OF ETHEL 
AND . 

JULIUS ROSENBERG 
by Robert [Rosenberg) Meeropol 

"History will record ... that we were victims 
of the most monstrous frame-up 

of our country."

Anti-abortion fight ... 
(Continued from page 1) 
are based o.n constitutional grounds. He cla ims tha t Reg Fee-
supported abortions are in violation of the California sta te 
constitution, Article One, Section One, which specifies that one of a 
person 's " inalienable rights" is the right to " defend liCe." 

Fischer also charges that Reg Fee-funded abortions violate 
Arti c le One , Section Four of the sta te constitu tion , which 
guarantees freedom of religion without threat of government 
discrimination. 

Moniot says that he and Fischer "disagree with the idea of 
paying money to support an activity, abortions, that goes against 
our consciences." 

Two other Berkeley students, Va lerie a nd David Eva ns, a re a lso 
attempting to be named co-plantiffs, but have paid their full fees in 
the hopes that they can recover their money if they are allowed to 
join the suit. 

Gynecological services ... . 
(Continued from page 1) 
more per student in health 
insurance. 

Sludent caucus 
Before the meeting, student 

members of the Advisory 
Committee got together to 
discuss both gynecological 
services and health insurance. 
Harris said the students 
decideagynecolagieal sentices 
should be subsidized, and also 
ajreed birth r.nnt.rnl services 
would be beneficial to the entire 
student population. 

Last year , the committee 

Tenure ••. 
(Continued from page 1) 

received a fair a mount of 
pressure from the Feminist 
Coalition to provide gynecologi-
cal services at the campus , said 
Harris . The coalition said 
annual examinations would 
help to prevent cancer a nd 
possible deaths attributed to 
such diseases. 

Another consideration of the 
cominltteewas thatH abortions 
were paid for and birth control 
services weren 't subsidized, 
the committee would be 
"asking for it, " said Harris. 

Real contended, " It is not clearly defined what anyone 
individual is supposed to do. It is very clearly a political process -
involving people who know other people who have assumptions 
and goals applying to the university." 

Potential members of the Ad Hoc Committee are supposedly 
chosen at random, but Real believes otherwise. "Members can be 
selected to give favorable or unfavorable recommendations 
depending on who is being reviewed," Real said . 

In the response report by Saltman and Reynolds in February 
1978 , statistical data reveals an apparently far from random 
selection method. 

Of " associate" and 16 fulltime professors at Third College, only 
five associate and ten fuJltime professors have ever been asked to 
serve on an Ad Hoc Committee. 

Certain professors (unnamed due to confidentiality) were asked 
once or twice while others were asked five and six times to serve . 
Other professors refused all requests to serve. 

When Questioned as to the general campus annual average 
faculty member of requests to serve on Ad Hoc Committees a nd 
the number of times of service, Saltman and Reynolds replied, 
"This inform ation is not readily a vailable and would be too time 
cons uming to assemble." 

Political ends 
P robably the most celebrated case in recent years at UCSD 

involves Dr. Will Wright, a sociologist denied tenure this year 
" because of an analysis of my published work." ' 

Wright charges he was not accorded the proper procedure 
because of his own de pa rtment . " The Sociology Department had 
not gi ven me information on how I had been reviewed," he stated . 

" My being denied tenure had nothing to do with my work. It had 
to do with my politics," said Wright, who classifies himself as a 
Marxist. 

Wright added, " I have a lot of firsthand evidence to believe so . 
Some of the senior sociology faculty who voted against me said it 
pad to do with my politics. The tenure process has nothing to do 
with teaching. " • 

Apparently there is more to the tenure review process than 
meets the eye. Part three of this series on Monday will look at 
specific professors' cases and answer questions concerning the 
validity of the process .

generated is about $4100. 

If this yea r 's income is used 
- parents fees, Registration

United Way - the figure 
generated is $2774. 

However, according to Rick 
Whitehill , As sociate Vice-

this year the Day Care Center is 
receiving aproximately $20,000 
from CET A, funds from work

included in the $2774 figure. 

The CET A funds were not 
in c luded in the Day Ca re

other campuses do not receive

Rev"ews: more pain than -pleasure 
by Ted Burke 

J.lanBY McLau.bUn, Electric Guitarist - John 
McLaughlin (Columbia) 

After three interesti~ albums with the all acoustic 
and raga oriented Shakti. guitarist McLaughlin plugs 
in again and re-teams himself with a number of 
stellar musicians he used to share band duties with. 
Accordingly, there are a variety of jazz styles on this 
disc. and McLaughlin proves himself comfortable in 
all of them. The highlight track here Is " Do You Hear 
the Voices You Left Behind", a post be-bop chase in 
the mold of John Coltrane's classic "Giant Steps" 
cflmposition. McLaughlin skillfully negotiates a 
c )mplex chord progression and solos with a 
',urprising spriteness. Chick Corea (piano) , Stanley 
Clarke (bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums) live up to 
their reputations. each maintaining a pulsating 
rhythm and offering their own inspired sorties .• , New 

You're Gonna Get It - Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers 

This time out, Petty and crew sound a bit less journeyman-like in their fairly mild manner brand of 
rock and roll . Petty's voice, a limited vehicle for self-
expression , is more soul-oriented this time out 
(though not soulful), and the band, especially in the 
guitar work, is crunchier, dirtier, and a little more 
committed to the mainstream rock and rollisms. In 
time. Petty and the Heartbreakers may become, as 
Mikel Toombs alluded to in his concen critique, a 
sturdy Rolling Stones type band. They have the sound 
and the song writing ta lent. All they need is a little 
more hysteria and bad luck. B.

Buddy Holly Uves - (MCA) 
This anthology of the late rocker's work is a bit on 

the syrupy side, but does include a few gems. "That'll 
Be the Day" , covered by Linda Ronstadt, is a classic 
of rockabilly verve, " Not Fade Away", covered by 
the Rolling Stones. featues a wonderfully tinny guitar 
and a splend idly chugga-chugga rhythm . and 
"Well" .AII Right" . best known by the short-lived 
Blind Faith is done acoustically in Holly's version, a 
sensitive rendering highlighting a nother side of bis 
trembling tenor voice. Other joys are "Peggy Sue", 
" Brown Eyed Handsome Man", and " 80 Diddly." If 
you ' re interested in hearing an artist who 's 
influenced the Beatles, as well as the aforementioned 
artists, Buddy Holly Lives should be in your 
collection. A minus. 

FM Soundtrack 
Does anyone really need to hear recent hits by 

Boston, Bob Seger. Linda Ronstadt. et ai, once more? 
I doubt it unless someone. for some reason known 
only to him or her and the God of their making, wants 
a perfect replication of lastsummer's FM rock shlock 
hit parade. F. 

Modern Man' - Stanley Clarke 
I cannot decide whether Clarke, one of the finest 

jazz bassists in the world. is, as a writer. either 
disingenuous or merely incompetent. This arty orgy 
of riffs and watery solos is enough to sucker the less 
knowledgeable . but those of us who know Clarke is 
capable of better are down right piqued. What does it 
say about ajazz album when the best improv is by Jere 
Beck? Not much , though Bec k can ' t be held 
accountable. F.
