of six students and thE' collE'RI:'

Th(' primary question of the

potential effect of this com-

there has been no precedent 
for total amnes.y for draft 
dodgprs, but, " we must deal 
With thp tens of thousands of 
young men who left this coun-
try becausl:' of th ir con-

war is over and the prisoners 
are home, and th n I will grant 
amnesty to these men." 

McGovern also stated that "I 
want to see a strong veterans' 
program in operation before 
dealing with amnesty. The 
purpo e of th is is to reconcile 
the country, not divide it. In 
the first 90 days I hope to move

In time science will find a way to ease all ills, of cours , but 
man cannot livp by thp tcst rube alone. There is a great deal 0 
mu ic III this world, and art and literature too . Could man 
have \urvived thp brutality of his wars and continued th 
exploration of the universe ..... ithout al~o creating from hi 
soul and testing the depths of his spirit? 

During the past week I have listened to " Reyelle scienr 
majors" as they complained of the Humanities Department, 
the Music Department, and the Visual Arts department. Fo 
many of these students the lower division, required courses in 
th(' arts will be their only contact with the world outsid 
science and math during college. They do not like Montai ne 
or Galileo (Humanities 5). They do not like banging on Coca-
Cola signs (Musir 10). Thev do not like watching three hours 
of slides per wpek of Grpek vas ~ and Roman statues (Visual 
Arts 15A). In hort, the Revell e student is more likely to 
describe the "arts" aspect of his education as "bori ng and 
terriole" than a "genuine exppriencC' In learning and 
creativ.ty'" 

II IS prens('ly ,1 ge nuine expert!'n('1:' in art for which the 
Rpvelle tudent i' searchillg. A IJr!W majority pxpresspd a 
desire' to lE'arn the rudiments of mu ic, dassicdl or contem 
porary, instf'Jd of learning how to operate squeJk~ doors 
They are finding it hard to reconcile thl:' sounds they hrM in 
cia s into music, df'spite assuran es from th professor that It 
is indeed music. They want to know why and how mUSIC, ;J, 
they know it, works . Why not listen to Beethoven or Dylan for 
an hour IllStNd of a humming saw? At least anothl:'r alter-
native should be ot fered to the sci nce student who ha, onl~ 
a brief journey s(heduled through the arts before the days of 
O-Chem . P-Chem, and l-Chem. 

Many Revellit(' are interested in ceramics, drawing, 
macrame, even basket we,lYing. They would rather satisfy thr 
arb requirement by cr ating with their hands instpad of 
passively viewing slides. They don't need to b told about the 
beauty of art Art is lived . If art 15 to survi ve, it mUlt be created 

For the Humanities Department kind words were few and 
far between. Six quarters of "ho-hum" leaves little time for 
individual exploration in the expansive world of literature . 
history, and philosophy. Many students enJoy analyzin" 
books and discussing what th y have read. These are the 
students who m an "it could be so much b Iter than it il. " 
They either want to make the Humanities sequence into 
something they can live with or scrap it altogether and spenc! 
the two years choosing dasses from the different departments 
in liberal arts. 

Dare one suggpst that the spi rit of Joyce be Instilled into the 
student who claims that the next war won't be one of rifles 
and tear gas? Can today 's world afford to produce more 
scientists insensitive to music and poetry, scientist who 
merely invent inventions and try desperately to be unaware 
of its applications? What would Schweitler say? Einstein? Da 
Vinci? 

There are too many potential artists on campus for the 
University to ignore their desires to learn the skills of an art 
they can relate to and ultimately be proud of the results they 
have achieved. A change is needed in the University's goals 
concerning the part they are to play in molding the attitudes 
and world-outlook of its students. The students themselve 
must also be responsible for helping the University to change 
lor modify the departments which do not satisfy their needs. A 
move toward a more artistic, creat ive, and aest hetic approach 
to life can only benefit both the student and the society in 

. live.

SCHEDULE 
Proposition 12 would permit the 

Legislature to grant a large property 
tax exemption to badly disabled 
veterans (e.g., those who have lost an 
arm and a leg) . The Legislature could 
grant an exemption of up to $10,000 of 
the value of the disabled person's 
home. There would be a nominal cost 
to the taxpayer.

Proposition 13 IS a measure which 
proposes to decrease state costs by 
dbout $1.8 million. At present, if a 
partially disabled workman receives a 
second or third injury, disability 
money comes from the General Fund 
Proposition 13, if passed, would 
authori7e the Legislature to declare 
that this money .s to be derived from 
the death benefits of persons who left 
no dependents. At the present time 
an employer has to pay no money if a 
person dies and leaves no 
depend nts. Proposition 13 would re-
qUire the employer to pay death 
benefits; this money would then be 
us('d for workman's compensation. 

The franch,;c tdX on bank~, c.or-
porallom, and insurers would be es-
tablished at 11 per cent. (This would 
aid banks and financial corporations. 
which now pay 11.6 per cent , oth('r 
corporations would be paying more 
than beforc.) Existing constitutional 
restrictions prohibiting imposition of 
variou~ lIate and local taxes or bank~ 
and insurer~ would be abolished . Thp 
Legislature would havp to approve 
state income increases by a two-thirds 
majority rather than a simple majority.

Contro~ersial 
Proposi tion 14 is a taxation proposal 
which has aroused a great amount of 
controve rsy in California. The 
proposal is far-reaching . It would pro -
hibit the state from imposing an ad 
valorem property tax (tax based on 
value) unless no o'her funds are 
dvailable to pay debts existing on July 
1, 1973. It would create ceiling rates 
lor local property tax, which would be 
reduced by 43 per cent. (This limita-
tion is subject to the condition that 
taxing agencies which exceeded this 
maximum during the fis al year 1971-
1972 can collect at this previous year's 
ratt' through the 1976-77 fiscal year.) 
The proposal would establish a base 
amount of $825 per pupil to be al-
located to public schools. The 
Legislature could change this amount 

State sales and use taxes would be 
Increased anri county sale and use 
taxes would be decreased . Taxes on 
Cigarettes and alccohol would be in-
creased a nd a tax equal to the com-
billed state and local property taxes 
would be imposed on those extract-
Ing gas, oil, and other minerals from 
the earth. (it should be noted that this 
mE'asure IS in conflict with ProposI-
tions 8, 10 and 12; if this measure IS 
approved and one or more of thl:' 
others also the one receiving the most 
votes will be adopted.)

Abolish "Education" Fee 
Last Spring the Stiern Amendment, 

a rider to the 1972-73 budget, was 
proposed to the Assembly and 
Legislature. The measure proposed 
to eli minate th e $100 per quarter 
educational fee. 

The rider was vetoed by Governor 
Reagan and the State Senate refused 
to attempt to override the veto in 
July. 

Because of this, this quarter UCSD 
students paid $212 in regi st ration 
fees. The Regents don't like the term 
"tui tion ." 

The reason the Regents don 't like 
the word " tuition" is because a state-
supported University is supposed to be 
free. 

Durin g Governor Brown's ad· 
ministration, student fees were $100 per 
quarter at the University of California. 

However, in 1970, under the ad-
ministration of Governor and ex-officio 
Regen t Reagan, the students were 
obliged to pay an additional $50.00 per 
quarter. This fee was raised in 1971 to 
$100. It was called the Educational Fee. 

This extra money was budgeted to the 
capital improvement program - it was 
called the "educational fee" but the 
monie~ were being us d for constructing 
buddlngs. 

The contention of the Governor 
was that students should pay for 
their share of their education . The 
ideal that UCSD students pay for 
their _education with a $636 yearly fee 
is absurd . 

Students could not begin to pay 
for the educational services the state 
provides. But to tax students for the 
construction of buildings when the 
state normerl y paid for them, and to 
expect students to take up the 
monetary slack the state is leaving 
the University 01 California is unfair. 

The TRITON TIMES urges the 
Regents, the UC Administration, and 

.th e students who are voting for 
leg islators whf) will decide lJC 
budget to consider carefully alter-
natives to higher student fees . 

The Regents fear that if the $100 
Educational Fee is abolished, the 
state will renege on the promise of 
finding alternative funding. 

The monie s ca me from 
somewhere during the "golden" UC 
years of the sixties - is it ion -
conceivable that they sti ll exist ? 

Utilities Shutdown 
This weekend Muir and Revelle 

resident students are being "i nvited" 
to go home. It seems that even 
though summer vacation ended only 
four weeks ago the Senior Super-
visor of Buildings and Utilities had to 
inform resident students that now 
was the only time that the Physical 
Plant work could be done. Why it 
had to wait until now, or why it 
cou ld not be delayed until an 
academ nic and administrative 
holiday, we don't know. 

This is deplorable planning. It 
seems to us that the inconvenience 
to resident students alone is grounds 
for a monetary reimbursement from 
room and board payments. And the 
audacity of "inviting" students to go 
home fo r the weekend!! How about 
those students who have no way of 
getting home, o r those who have 
ontinuing experiments that don't 

take weekends off, or th o~e who 
have mid-terms next week . Comp 
on, gang! You can do better i han 
that. 

Third College Support 
We are continUing to watch the 

emergence of Third College as an 
approach to providtng for the needs 
of Third World peopl s in America . 
It i'i a unique experiment, and one 
that is mor difficult and trying than 
most realile. 

This year repres nts another 
milestone for Third College. More 
innovative Ideas are' being tested. 
Many al ernatlve teaching ,tyles are 
berng trred. And most Important, 
students and faculty arc garning In-
'ilgf,t into helping communi ties 

striving for existence, recognition 
and acceptance. 

This year, more than ever before 
Th,rn College n(>eds the suppor! of th; 
Universi ty community. The TRITON 
TiMES recogniles this need and 
urges all to support this proud effort. 
There are no "ifs" about it. Third 
College must ucceed . With our sup-
pori, it will not go down as a token 
plfort of a few. Third ollege will 
contlnu to grow and provide 
amwers and solutions to many of the 
probl ms of Third World om-
munities in America.

McGovern I I: T he Philospher 
in Wonderland 

Kevin S. O lson 
My previous article, wh ich detailed the 

wealth of,stunning contradictions that have 
been emanating from the Credibility Can-
didate, apparently did not penetrale the 
ideological blinders of our local Youth for 
McGovern, who glibly maintain that 
" McGovern has changed a few details in 
his positions, but his basic philosophy has 
never changed." For the record , then, I 
should like to outline McGovern's basic 
philosophy, which is perhaps most kindly 
described as an irrational and infantile 
journey into Alice's Wonderland . 

Having discovered that the vast majority 
of Americans support the President's 
policies on Vietnam and defense, the 
McGovern Campaign has now shifted its 
emphasis to the economy. I will not deal 
here with McGovern's budgetary pro-
posals, which from National Review to the 
New York Times have become a major 
laughingstock to all those skilled in 
arithmetic. Instead, I will deal with his 
':Jasic philosophical contentions, which are 
(a) that the rich pay no, or very little, taxes, 
and (b) that the poor concomitantly share 
the greater burden of tues. 

The fact is that almost all citizens whose 
incomes are below the poverty level do 
not pay federal taxes. At the present 
moment, the minimum income level at 
which the tax applies is $2,050 for a single 
person and $4,300 for a family of four - -
any person or family with an income 
below these levels simply does not pay 
federal taxes. Furthermore, these income 
levels (which incidentally are greater than 
the income of many self-supporting UCSD 
students, single or married), are by any 
reasonable standards well above the 
poverty line. 

So much for (b), now let us turn to (a) 
and all those fat-cat rich who puff on their 
cigars, swim in their pools, and never pay 
taxes . Once again, the myth is exploded: 
wh ile it is true that a minute number (frac-
tion of 1 %J of those with high "adjusted 
gross incomes" showed no net taxable in-
come, it is also true that vast majority of 
persons with high adjusted gross incomes 
are paying quite heavy federal income 
taxes. The followi ng table, from T.S. New 
and World Report, shows the preliminary 
statistics on income for 1970:

There's Something 
Happening Here 

Bob Benson 
George Orwell predicted the evolution of 

a ce rlain metastable world situation by the 
Y{'J r 1984, dnd described it in a book which 
most of us have read at leas t once. Aldous 
Huxley foresaw thp possib ility of an entire-
ly different evo luli on. ry track for th e 
world; his Bravp New World is anot her 
classic Th se men both looked far into their 
fUlures. and what they thought they saw in-
'plr(,d th('m to dC tually write books about it. 

You may hav(> a vision of your own future, 
and you may hav(> you r own opinion about 
where Mankind IS headed. But one thing 
we thin k we know for sur is thi s: What 
happem now allects what happens later 
(how much depends on wh n " now" is, 
amonK othe r things) . Thus, what you do (or 
don't do) affects what you and you r en-
vi ronment become. Your part may bf' small 
or not so small; that's under your control 
(for th tim beinll) to some d gr . The 
impli alions her(>, if not obvious, are worth 
pursuing. 

Average Tax 
Paid 

$984,662 
$483,089 
$177,161 
$73,678 
$28,866 

The fat -cat image crumbles when we 
realize that the average millionaire pays 
close to a million dollars yearly in taxes-a 
considerable portion of which , i n-
cidentally, goes to support those who do 
not work and do not pay federal taxes. For 
those with incomes over a million dollars, 
the effective tax was 46.4% of their ad· 
justed gross income and 65.3% of their net 
taxable income. For those with incomes 
above $200,000, the effective tax was 44.1 
per cent of the adjusted gross income and 
59.5% of their net taxable income. The 
poor, on the other hand, pay no federal 

. taxes at all. Not only are the rich paying 
more than their "fair share" in taxes, th ey 
are being bled quite freely by the mam-
moth bureaucracy of the welfare state . 

Finally, it should be noted that the 
underlying motivation behind M c-
Govern's economic theories is the crypto-
Marxist assumption that it is somehow a 
crime to be rich . We hear talk of "ine-
quality" and of " redistribution of wealth 
and income." This is basically an attack on 
ambi tion, ability, productivity, and the 
other capitalist values that have made 
America the most prosperous and free 
country in recorded history. The philoso-
phical basis behind this attack is ma ss 
egalitarianism, that perversion of thp 
Western belief in the equality of all men 
before the eyes of the law. Egalitarianism 
insists that all men must be leveled and 
homogenized to the same economic and 
socio-cultural status, maintaining that we 
all have a " right" to a guaranteed annu al 
income, a college education, and a happy 
married life. It is thus a perversion, for it 
stands contrary 10 the facts of biology and 
history, and contrary to the traditions of 
our Western civilization . 

Such a corrosive philosophy would b 
bad enough, but it is made ludicrou s by 
the co nsistent hypocrisy of the candidate 
who proclaims it as his "new populism." 
Item : The personal worth of George 
McGovern is estimated at over $200,000, 
and he chose as his running mate a 
limousine liberal whose principal ac -
complishment has been marrying into one 
of the rich st fami lies in America . Item: 
McGovern voc iferou sly atta cks th(> 
"specia l privileges for the rich" while 
simu lt aneously organizing the Woon-
socket Club-an elitist privat e club whose 
membership is limited to those who have 
donated $25,000 or more to his campaign, 
and which bestows "special privileges" to 
its VIP m mbers. And so on ad infinitum 

Such is the " populism," the "economic 
JU tice" of the Credibility Candidate. Is 
there method in this madness? There is, 
but it is the method of the politi cian, of 
the man who makes of issues and ideas 
what he wants of them . To paraphrase 
Lewis a rroll : 

"There's economic justice for you I" said 
Humpty Dumpty. 

" I don't know what you mean by 
'economic justice,'" said Alice. 

Humpt y Dumpt y smil ed co nt emp-
tuously. " Of ourse you don 't-till I tell 
you. I meant ' there's higher taxes for those 
who pay the most, lower ta xes for thos(> 
who pay th least, and free mon y to all 
those who don't work!" 

" But '(>conomic justice ' doesn' t m('dn 
'higher ta xes for those who pay the most. 
lower taxes for those who pay the least, 
and fre money to all thosp who don't 
work ,'" Alice objected . 

"Wh n I use an issue, " Humpty Dump-
ty said, in a rdther scornful tone, " it means 
just what I choose it to mean- neither 
more nor less." 

"The question is," said Alice, " whether 
you C3n mak i sues mean so many 
different things."

New Course 
Proposal 

Editor: 
This is a simple not ion I have 

about a possible course se-
quence which I believe might 
prove interesti ng and . worth 
while to students. It might be 
laught under a Humanities 
rubric. The cou rse would be 
based upon thf' writ ing by and 
abou t Nobel Peace Prize 
winners. Simpl e? Yf'S , but 
think about it a bit. 

I am writing thi s here 
because I have no dear id a of 
how to make this suggeation 
to people who mighl bring it 
about.

At the risk of beating a dead 

horse, or lust the rear end 
thereof, I want to add a few 
words to the cacophony about 
"A Broad View." Most of what 
I say may seem to be directed 
at th womE'n on Ih is campus. 
That'S not the way I want it to 
be. I want to talk to my bro-
t hE'rs as w II as my '>Isters 

Th{' present culture in this 
(ountry plits peopl e (read 
Ihat bOlh men ami women) 
Into two parts-body olnd 
mind. In this culture, men are 
minds, womf'n Me bodIes. 
(onse quently th ose who 
begin 10 qu(>stion our present 

.1 ue wstl?m are Il?d to react 
.Igalnsl it bv ('mphasiTing the 

opposite sides of th ir natures. 
Women begin to emphasize 
the needs of thei r mind,> (you 
can read "souls" if you wish) 
and men begin to f'mphasize 
the needs of their bodies. This 
situation IS a n cl?ssary st p to-
ward the healing of all the 
psychologica l spli ts we havf' 
and the cmergl?nce of all of U'i 
as wholly integrated human 
beings. 

I think thf' eventual result of 
the e deVl'lopments can be a 
society of people who can 
acknowledge and act on Iheir 
own needs and df'sires and 
accept th needs and desires 
of other~ unCrItically. 

I feel that for my_elf there is 
no ideal basis on which I mUIr 
form a relationsh ip with a 
woman . A solid, ca ring con-
nection between two people 
can start with sE'xual intimacy 
just as easily as it can start with 
long talks or with play. What I 
hope I'll see around here soon 
are people, both men and 
women , who ran react to 
si tuations in wa ys which satisfy 
them as peoplE', not as either 
minds or bodie~ . We are minds

CLOSED CAFETERIA 

Thl'i pa<;\ week we have been 
bl('ssed with rain. P rhaps thi s 
,eason will not be as dryas last yea rs 
\\:1' hope not. 

\\ Ith the onset of the rainy wason 
\\p have seen a familiar pattern 
de\elop: everyon moves indoors. 
Rut this year the pattern has been 
lomewhat altered. The cafeteria on 
(dmpUS are "closed ." That is, they 
Jre open to resi dent students wh o 
ore paying a flat fe for food, or they 
are open to anyone willing to pay 
the cost of an entire meal. There is 
no other wa y one can gain entrance 
to the cafeteria s. 

'ihar(' their thoughts, regardless of 
the weather. 

ThC' TRITON TIME demands that 
the tafeterias be opened to all 
rnemhE'rs of the UnivNsity com-
munity as an informal meeting place. 
We fepl that with careful planning a 

~ood ~ '~tem can be deVised to allow 
the present resident studen t meal 
plan to be conttnued while opening 
up the dining areas to th e communi-
ty, 

Vote!

When thi s campus was d esigned it 
was understood that the majority of 
~tu dents attending UC D would bE' 
commuter students. In the pas t, 
lommuter st udents have had free 
Jcce,s to the cafe terias as places to 

~ tudy, relax with friend s, and buy 
items to supplement m als (coffee, 
rloughnu ts, etc.l. 

This is no longer possible. 
This is an intoler,lble situation. W e 

have no student "u nion" facilities to 
offer ~tude nts a place to si t and do as 
they please. With the continuing 
problem of isolation o n this campu, 
WI? have no place in which student , 
t.Hu lty and taf f can at and 

We hope that thi ~ problem will be 
olved within the immediate future . 

Until such time resident students will 
cont inue to "enjoy" their meals 
within glas walls, isolated from the 
rest of the community during one of 
the be~t time, available to get to 
know others. 

A dosed cafete ri a system would 
be acceptable if the dormitories 
were isolated from the rest of the 
main ampus (such a UCLA). 
However, here th is was not done 
deliberatply, to include resident 
q udenh in as many on-campus ac-
tivitie, as po~sible. 

If it " tound that a closed cafeteria 
'iystem l annot allow for a meeting 
place tor the entire community, then 
.lnother sy tern must be found .

Thi s week it's the San Diego Chargers again, th is time 
aga inst the Lion s of Detroit. Last week the Chargers Were 
handed a clean defeat at the h ands of the angered Dolph ins. 
Even though they managed to put "greasy" Bob out of action 
for the season and even though they outgained the Dolph inS 
in the air and on the ground, they still lost by 14 points. Per-
haps it was because of the passing of backup (perennial) man 

• Earl Morral and the three intercept ions and one fumble by 
the Chargers. 

Anyway, on to Detroit , The Chargers this year have used 
up until last week, a very strict running game similar to that oi 
the Packers of Yore . Mike Garret leads the NFL in rushin g, but 
John Hadl is second from the bottom in passes attempted and 
probably first in interceptions thrown . The defense is about 
third in the league against rushing but very poor against the 
Long Bomb. In every game except for their first, a humil-
iating defeat to San Francisco, the Chargers have outgained 
th ei r opponents by as much as 150 yards. Those teams were 
no patsies ei ther (Oakland, Balt imore, Denver, Miami) . Any-
way, tf the Chargers can keep the turnovers to a minimu m 
(like none) then they might even make it to the playoffs. 

Detroit, on the other hand is one of those ordinary NFL 
teams that has a quarterback thaI can run better than he can 
pass. Greg Landry can pass, though, as he proved against the 
Atlanta Falcons . Th ey have managed to beat one good team 
and lose to some mediocre ones (a heartbreaker against 
Greenbay last weekI. They have a highly respected defense 
and a playoff-capab le offense, but this lime we Sf'e the 
Chargers by eight points bpcause of thpir all-around great 
playIng and thplr all-star deff'nse. Our computer thinks II will 
be a game to watch if it 's on the tube. 

That 's all for this week, midterm~, you know.

one of positive optimism. 
Coach Buchdncln especially 
feels that the support of the

An aura of optimiSm sur -
rounds the UCSD basketball 
program so far this short year. 
The number of students at 
tryouts thi s week suggested an 
increase in student interest in 
the sport. The number of peo-
ple watching the workout was 
also so mewhat surprising, 
numbering almost as much as 
those who went to the games 
last year. The team's journey to 
Hawaii is also influencing the 
program in a positive sense. 
Perhaps the greatest a mount 
of the new look th is year stems 
from a cha nge in coaching and 
in the organization of the 
program itself. The varsity 
coach, Bill Reeves, has already 
been introduced to the stu-
dent body on thi s page . 
However, there is another new 
face around the gym these 
days. He is usually spotted in a 
pair of UCSD grey cotton 
sweats and a UCSD baseball 
cap with a whistle dangling 
around his neck . This is the

However. considering the 100-plus wild 
and motley crew at both Squaw Valley 
and Jackson Hole last year . you 'd better 
get those tickets earlyl First come. first 
serve! And because you 're no dummy. 
you 'll need to start saving a lillie bit of 
bread to go. Oon 't despair. nowl The 
entire cost of the package is "only" 
$164.00 by plane . and $139.50 by bus . 
But such a deal! You get: 5 conttnental 
breakfasts. 5 nltes delux lodging at 
Wildwood Inn and Silver Tree Inn (at the

welcom es the opportunity to 
deal with more mature college 
players who will react quicker 
a nd cooperat e better than 
younger people. 

Another primary reason for 
his being on the UCSD staff is 
his rapport with coach Reeves. 
He has played for and admired 
both the man and the 
coaching of Bill Reeves. He IS 
looking forward to the chance 
of working with his formN 
high school mentor 

One of the major problems, 
as coach Buchanan SE'es It, 
facing the new coaches is the 
ability of the players. This does 
not mean the players have no 
ability; quite the contrary, 
they have quite a bit; rather 
the question IS finding out 
which players have the most 
talent. Th is the coaches are in 
the process of determining 
right now. 

The schedule also IS rather 
interesting. There are some 
tough spots , but the junior 
varsity, as far as coach 
Buchanan sees It , Will definIte-
ly have a winning record. The 
major competItIon will 
probably come from USIU and 
San Diego State.

An Ed itor' s Reply (cont. ) 
suggested as an answer. The 
whole point of the /ight 
show (and of the discus-
sion afterward> was that 
both war and the drug pro-
blem are cau I'd by what 
man is: by nature sinful and 
sepa rated from (he God 
who loves him. And in no 
way can drugs change what 
man is, or provide a perma-
nent escape from (he con-
sequences of (his. P ycho-
analysts may tell you what 's 
wrong with you, but they 
can't change what you are. 

Christ never promispd 
those who belIeved III Him 
permanent im/ation from 
the world's problem;-he 
presented them in<IPad 
wil h a plan 10 changE' the 
world itself. Tha t's eXdctly 
w hy the ligh t show wal pre-
sented. And (hat 's why 
Christians will continup to 
obey Ch r ist's command and 
preach Ihe Gospel a; long 
as rhere are rhose who 
haven'r heard.
