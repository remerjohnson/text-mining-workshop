Aware that students were 

getting ready to vote today, 
daycare supporters and 
opponents made a last, pre-
election attempt to sway 
students to their side 
yesterday . 

saying that there were " two 
ways of approaching a budget, 
one to evaluate it in terms of 
effect, the other in amount. " 

Victoria Brown of the Decent Daycare Committee faces of Scott McBride of the Committee for 
Justice in Spending Committee at yesterday's daycare debate. pItoto.,.. St ... HOM. 

Victoria Brown of the 
Committee for Decent Day-
care and Scott McBride of the 
Justice in Spending Committee 
traded arguments at a 
Guardian sponsored noon 
debate in the North Conference 
room of the Student Center, 
repeating the arguments the 
two had used throughout the 
campaign. 

The Center, she said. allowed 
working mothers to attend the 
university, and cited a study 
which she said i,ndicated that 
mothers who work make better 
parents. She added that women 
with children make up the 
fastest growing pool of 
potential UC applicants, 
arguing " if we 're going to 
compete with other univer-
sities, we have to appeal to 
them." SDSU Slashes Faculty She also said by making the 
university more accesible to 
working mothers, the univer-
sity was making itself " richer 
by providing for a more 
heterogenous campus pop-
ulation and better paying jobs 
in the community for women." 

Cuts Draw Widespread Protests McBride told the approx-imately 75 people in attendence

Cuts of from 60 to 80 faculty 

po itions from SDSU's budget 
will not 1fOl' 0 eUeet until July 
I , but president Thomas Day's 
decision to make the cuts by 
eliminating departments has 
already drawn protests from 
nearly every quarter. 

Day announced a list of seven 
departments to be considered 
in depth, and criteria for 
evaluati ng which would be 
eliminated, two weeks ago: 
Since then faculty employee 
organizations, the Associated 

Students , and community 
lobbies have all objected to the 
plan. 

Day said he chose the 
"progr mmatic" approach to 
"avoid gradually weakening 
the entire university." The 
usual alternative of making 
across-the-board cuts is no 
longer possible, Day main-
tains. 

Student and faculty 
organization's have responded 
that more time should be taken. 

"There is an irrevocable 
aspect to eliminating an entire 
department," Dr . Prescott 

To Meet With Students 
Ford to be Here 
Thursday, Friday 

Former President of the United States Gerald Ford will be on 
campus this Thursday and Friday, addressing classes, meeting 
with faculty and students ~nd with members of the community . 

Ford will meet with three classes Thursday, including a 
Political Science 11 class and Economic students taught by 
D.V.T. Bear and Richard Attiyeh. He will also address a general 
tudent meeting Thursday at 3 pm in Mandeville Auditorium and 

hold a press conference for San Diego press at 10 am in 
Chancellor'S Complex IliA. 

Arrangements for admission to the classes and Mandeville 
lecture are being handled by ticket, but his Mandeville 
appearance is already sold out. 

Ford will also appear at University House Thursday night, home 
of Chancellor McElroy, for a dinner and reception with the Board 
of Overseers and Chancellor'S Associates. 

Friday, Ford will meet with a faculty seminar of approximately 
120 professors, then meet with twenty "student leaders" for 40 
min'ltes. The students were selected by AS PresidentJohn Jenkel, 
AS Public Relations Commissioner Carlos Montalvo and student 
organizations Advisor Randy Woodard. , 

Ford will conclude his campus appearance Friday at noon. 
Security for Ford's appearance will be heavy. Secret service 

and campus police (but no city police) will all aid in the security 
effort, some of them in plainclothes, Public Information 
repre entative Chuck Colgan says. 

Ford will receive $10,000 for hi one and a half days on campu , 
$5,000 from the American Enterprises Institute, a conservative 
strategy and policy options organization, and $5,000 from the 
Chancellor, appropriated through funeb donated to the University 
by the Chancellor'S Associate .

Daycare 
Recommenda tions 

••• ••• 
Question one: "B" - Funding at present level 
Question two: Abstain 
Question three: "No" - Children of faculty 

and staff excluded from center, 

The Daycare referendum is today, and we urge you to 
vote, but there's another election today that not too many 
people know about. 

The campus residence hall councils want to increase the 
yearly campus residence halls activity fee from $6 to $10 per 
student, the added fees to be split between the campus 
dormitories and apartments and the various residence hall 
councils. 

Letters to the Editor 
• 

In order for the residents' fees to be raised, atleast 25% of 
the resident population must vote, and at least two-thirds of 
those voting must vote "yes" for the fee to be raised. 

Staff, Faculty Children 
We recommend that students living on campus support 

the raise in fees. The various living units on campus suffer 
from a lack of adequate funding for activities. 

. Should Be in the Center 
More money for on-campus residence units would 

increase the presently meager "official" activity level, and 
should make living on campus a mtle more pleasant.

Your Room ... See the AS 

Editor: 
Hey, if you _haven't heard 

about it yet, let me tell you 
about THE thing to do for 
laughs on those long, boring 
Wednesday nights. It may be 
the best kept secret on cam pus! 
Here's what you should do: slip 
into the North Conference 
Room sometime around, oh, 
seven o'clock p.m. and get 
ready for some real entertain· 
ment. Some people call it the AS 
Council, but I call it "pure 
fun"! 

People from three student 
media organizations and 
myself were rolling in the aisle 
with the antics and monkey-
shines of the people we voted 
into office . Although the 
majority of the council 
performs their job to 

parlimentary perfection, it's 
those few witty crazies who 
stand out. One of the 
rapscallions, on a crucial vote 
abstained, changed his 
abstention to support the 
measure and then asked, much 
to the delight of those present. 
what exactly it was he was 
voting "yes" on , A carnival 
atmosphere prevailed as 
council members frustratedly 
debated and argued in 
language that would make a 
sailor blush. People were 
talking on the side and others 
were trying to ssssh them into 
silence, only increaSing the 
noise to a deafening din. 
Finally, the Chair came into the 
act, chiding the council for 
making the AS look like a 
circus, which sent the clowns 

into hysterics. 

I'm sorry there were actually 
people present who look their 
tasks seriously; they didn ' t 
belong in that "Theater of the 
Absurd ," as I heard a group 
named it (I can't remember the 
group's name but hum a few 
bars and I think I can fake it). 

Listen, take my word for it: 
it's a ball! One hour at the 
North Conference Room on 
Wednesday nights and you 'll, 
like me, never complain again 
about paying student activity 
fees each year to help support 
the council. Oh yeah, be sure to 
bring a lot of paper for paper.

participation in the campus 
Daycare Center (question 3 on 
the Referendum) . 

I am a faculty father who has 
been much involved in the 
Center, and who was angered 
and upset at the Adminis· 
tration's decision to oust the 
children of staff and faculty this 
summer. There are a number 
of reasons why students should 
vote "yes" on question 3. 

(1) Quality daycare is 
essential to all children, no 
matter who their parents are. 
Starr and f<lculty need this 
service as much as students do. 
The main reason why parents 
fought so hard last year to keep 
the present center open was not 
because the UCSD center cost 
less than private centers 
(that's true lhis year because of 
the SDE subsidy: last year the 
fees werecomparab'leorhigher 
than othel' centers in the areLl' . 
Parents supported this center 
beCLlUse of the superior care 
and educational services it 
provides. and a shortage of 
such care elsewhere. 

(2) UCSD claims to be 
commiUed to Affirmath'e 
Action in hiring women and 
minorities. It is a £act that 
many women are discouraged 
£rom even seeking a job 
because of a lack of decent, 
affordable, convenient day· 
care. The need is even more 
acute in single p<Jrent families . 
Keeping sWff and facult~· 
children out of the lICSD center 
is hardly consistent with 
achieving' Affirmati\'C Action 
goals. 

(3) Popular notions about 
stller and faculty's abilities 10 

~Ierorcl eX)JCnsiv~ daycan.' are 
(unfortunately!) largely 
incorn.·ct. "',,culty real salaries 
have dedined 17-30' 1, over the 
past 10 years. Junior faculty . 

who arrived LIfter the housing 
crunch, are especially hard hit. 
I recently discovered that I 
earn less', on a yearly basis, 
than the undergrLlduate 
programmer employed in my 
labo ...... tory. I certainly do not 
begrudge this student his 
enviable salary - he is highly 
skilled and very competent. 
However, students should be 
aware that fLlcully .Ire not 
exactly o\'erpaid, and staff on 
the a\'erage have an e\'en 
harder time of it. 

(4) Because of their long· 
term commitment. staff and 
faculty parents have played LIn 
important role over the years in 
fighting to kcep the lICSD 
center open (perhaps this is one 
reason why the Administrution 
was so anxious to get rid of us 
this summer) . Staff and fuculty 
have been especially importHnt 
in keeping enrollment .lDd 
income up during the summer 
months when students arc 
away . 

No one is proposing that 
student Reg Fees be used to 
subsidize non·student children. 
The issue is whether sl"lrr ;md

Get the Facts and Vote For Daycare 
Erlitor: 

The discussion of daycare in 
Wt'dl1esday 's Guardian raised 
more questions thun it 
answered. We would like Lo 
wke this opportunity to clarify 
a number of issues. 

First, it is terribly important 
that everyone understand that 
the Committee for Decent 
Daycare - the "daycare 
supporters" - did not write 
this referendum. The questions 
we will be voting on were 
framed by the Daycare 
InformCltion Board, an 
unbiased, seven·member 
committee appointed by the 
Reg. Fee Committee. the AS 
and thc GSC (Graduate Student 
Co uncil) . 

Thus, it is totally inaccurate 
to charge that daycare 
supporters are "asking for 
$84,000," What the daycare 
supporters are asking is that 
UCSD students help us muke 
the best of el bad situation. The 
referendum questions are 
lCrrible: they arc confusing, 
misleading. bureLlucratic, and 
hO)JClcssly hypotheticul. When 
[:Iced with those que. tion . we 
had a choice : to p:.lrticip<lte in 
the referendum or boycott? 
Had we boycotted, we would 
h<lve looked like poor sports. 

More importantly, we would 
have lost the daycare center. 

So, too question became: 
what to recommend on each 
question? We decided to ask 
that students vote the 
maximum on both questions 
because we know that the KEY 
FACT about this referendum is 
that it is ADVISORY. The 
structure of the questions gives 
the impression that voters are 
actually setting the daycare 
budget. Don 't be fooled by 
appearances. Read the 
questions again, carefully . This 
referendum does not set the 
daycare budget. It sets UCSD's 
daycare policy ; it tells the Reg. 
Fee Committee whether 
students want u daycare 
center, whether they think it 
should be expanded, a nd what 
absolute maximum limit 
should be set Cor any future 
daycare budget. 

You may not feel comfortable 
being quite as "symbolically 
positive" as we are. But please 
- don't throw the bab out with 
the budget. Tell Reg . Fee that 
daycare deserves el legitimate 
hearing in each year 's Reg. Fee 
deliberations. BecauSE' that's 
all a victory means. It only 
gives the Daycare enter the 
right to go to Reg. Fee each 

year. like everyone else, and 
submit its budget. And it only 
sets a limit on how high toat 
budget can go. 

Scott McBride's letter says at 
one point thell we are asking for 
$126,000 and at another that we 
see $84,000. Which is it, Mr. 
McBride? The truth is that the 
Daycare Center - which 
received $25,000 Crom Reg Fee 
this year - has submitted a 
request for $16,000 from Reg. 
Fee for next year. That's a 
budget cut of 34%. We are the 
only student organization that 
submitted iJ lower budget for 
1979·80 . 

Let's be logical here. The 
parents want cam pus daycare. 
Don't you think we would go 
along with less expensive care 
if it was feasible? Do you think 
we like putting our education 
and our kids on the line like 
this? Of course not. But we ' ve 
done the research. And the 
Daycare Information Board 
has done tile research, And we 
both concluded thutthe kind of 
daycare we h'.lVe at CSD is 
what everyone - including 
tho e from the Childcare 
Inform ation etwork -
regards as basic , non· 
damaging childcare. 

Mr. McBride thinks it's a 

scandal that 93% of the 
Daycare Budget goes to 
personnel. Do your homework 
Mr. McBride. All daycare 
centers spend from 85·95% on 
personnel (depending on rent 
costs); the fact U1at such a high 
percentage of our budget goes 
to personnel proves that we 
don't spend money on frills. Wr; 
meet the sta£fing requirementS 
set by the state of California 
and pay our staff at the rates set 
by the University of California . 

The Daycare Information 
Board considered offering a 
pri vate dayc<.lre rranchise as <In 
option on the referendum. H 
finally decided not to because it 
determined that th is would cost 
lIC D and the parent more 
money. Why? Bccause with II 
private center, UCSD would 
lose its $66,000 subsidy from the 
state of California. The state 
doesn 't fund Mr. McBride's 
cheaper, "quali ty " center 

be '<!'Ise those centers do not 
meet State Department of 
Education standards. Cheaper 
centers are only ' cheaper 
because they hire fewer people 
to take care of more kids.

The AS Minority View 
Warren Officials Dispute Daycare Suppo,rters 
Argue That Center Money Better Spent Elsewhere 

Edito r : 
On Wednesday, February 14, 

the ASUCSD made a statement 
of policy which supports 
Daycare funding {rom student 
Regi tration Fees. Though this 
decision was by no mea ns 
unanimous, it was arrived at by 
a majority vote Llfi.er clear and 
ca lm arguments were pre· 
sented by both sides . The 
reason for this letter is that the 
ASUCSD statement of policy is 
being I}rinted in today's 
Guardian. As I voted against 
this statement, I fell that it was 
necessary to present an 
opposing view. 

The end of the second 
paragraph of the ASUCSD 
statement declares that, "It 
would be illogical to assume 
that something unnecessary for 
one student should abolish what 
is essential for another. To be 
preoccupied with the wants and 
needs of only the individual is 
arbitrary, prejudicial, and 
contrary to the very founda· · 
tiollal principles upon which the 
Associated Students arc built." 
Generully speaking. this 
st<.l tement is true. However, in 
this issue of Daycare funding , 
through Student Registration 
Fees. I believe thut it is 
stretching the principle, At this 

lime , there are many 
Registr<.ltion funded items that 
serve <.I minority of the 
students . A few of these 
minority funded items ar 
lntercollegiute Athletics, 
OASIS, and Cureer Planning 
and Placement. How does 
Daycare differ from the above 
services'? In the first place, 
every student hLls the

NEWS BRIEFS 
From the Associated Press 

Meany Will Help Monitor 
Conformity to Wage Limit 

BAL HAnROR. Fla. (AP) - AFL-CIO 
~resident George Meany brushed aside 
suggestions that he retire ,and announced 
yesterday that he is mobilizing federation 

member~ ' .:> blow the whistle on companies thllt 
excecd President Carter's anti-inflation price 
guidelines. 

Meany also vowed to continue to criticize 
Carter's policies when organized labor 
disagrees with them. He denied his attacks 
signify a break with the president and said he 
and Carter had a pleasant conversation 
Monday. 

"I think he (Carter) makes some mistakes 
and, frankly, I will continue to comment on 
those mistakes." Meany said, adding : " The 
president doesn't seem to be upset about It." 

Meany said he had promised to help monitor 
violations of the price guidelines. Meany said 
C rter had called the labor leader to ask for the 
federation's help, and that Carter thought the 
AFL-CIO's plan to create a national price 

wutch-dog network was "very good." 
Meany spoke to reporters ufter the AFL-CIO 

leadership completed another session of its 
annual week-long winter meeting. 

He said continued sharp rises in the price of 
food, housing and other necessities prove that 
Carter's voluntary progrum of wage-price 
guidelines is not working. 

Meany said he hoped price monitoring reports 
submitted by AFL-CIO 13.5 million members 
would convince the administration that the 
program should be replaced by mandatory 
wage-price controls. 

The AFL-CIO contends that under a voluntary 
program, businesses will hold down wage 
increases but not price increases. As a result. 
the federation predicts inflation this year will 
exceed the 9 percent rate set last year. 

Carter wants wage and fringe benefit 
increases held to 7 percent a year and has asked 
business to hold price boosts under increases of 
the past two years. 

INTERNATIONAL 
Egypt, Israel Begin Camp David Talks 

WASHINGTON (AP) - Egypt and I rael 
open another round of secret peace negotiations 
today at snow-covered Camp David, with 
prospects for completing a Mideast peace treaty 
complicated by recent events in Iran. 

On the eve of the talks, Egypt warned Israel 
that the "situation in the region is dangerously 
tense" and urged the Israelis to realize that a 
comprehensive peace settlement is vital. 

" There is no place left for maneuvering and 
procrastination," the government-run Cairo 
radio said in a news commentary entitled 
"peace at the Camp David table again." 

"There can be no peace in the Middle East 
unless Palestinian autonomy is settled. And, 
there shall be no peace in the region until Israel 
gives back the Egyptian Sinai, the Syrian Golan, 
and the Jordanian West Bank," the radio said. 

Chinese Move Ten Miles Into Vietnam 
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - Striking behind 

a heavy artillery barrage, Chinese troops 
yesterday captured the big Vietnamese border 
town of Lao Cai, but Vietnamese defenders 
routed some Chinese units elsewhere in the 
mountainous border country, according to 
reports in Bangkok and Hanoi. 

Thai intelligence sources in Bangkok said the 

NATIONAL 

Chinese had thrust as far as 10 miles into 
Vietnam, four miles beyond their deepest 
penetration reported Monday. Vietnam's U.N . 
ambassador said in New York the invaders had 
advanced 12 miles into Vietnam. 

Hanoi claimed Peking's troops were resorting 
to chemical warfare, firing shells filled with 
.. toxic substances."

Reg Fee Votes to Maintain 
Present OASIS Funding 

8y John Hondros 
Associate News ,.:dilllr 

The Registration Fee 
Committee yesterday voted to 
continue to support OASIS atits 
present level of funding, but 
refused to allocate monies 
toward its new programs. 

Chancellor's Advi ory om-
mittce on Instru ctio nal 
Improvemcnt Policy and 
Policy Review Committee for 
these funds. 

Financial aid services was 
the first Student Affairs unit 
under review of the committee 
last week. Tom Rutter. director 
oC student financi al services, 
informed the committee on how 
financial aid operates, the 
problem it face with work 
loads and future plans to insta II 
a mini-computer. , 

In order to take care of the 
added work load due to the 
recently passed Middle Income 
Student Assistance Act , 
Fi nancial Services requested 
an additional two to four FTEs 
- two to begin with and two to 
hold in reserve. The committee 

approved the budget as written 
with the exception of sup-
porting two. rllther than four. 
FTEs. 

According to Reg Fee Intern 
Jun Dooley, "students are very 
confused about financilll 
aid ... We want to find out why so 
many students are displeased 
with the service. and how come 
information is not clear and 
contra dictory." The committee 
voted to go through Student 
Financial Service's and " get 
them to look into these 
problems . " 

The Reg Fee Committee, 
which serves as an advisory 
board t'O the Vice Chancellor of 
Student Affairs , is currently 
undergoing its budget review of

Guthrie an Anamoly in Male Business 

Janet Guthrie 
plooto ".11 St." Ho.do 

Woman Stock Car Driver, First Female 
at Indy, Talks About Her Life, Job 

By Kathy Huffer 
Senior Staff Writer 

"Man doesn't live by words 
alone, but he sometimes has to 
eat them. " Janet Guthrie told a 
receptive audience last night. 

Guthrie, the [irst woman to 
race in and finish the 
Indianopolis 500, discussed her 
unique role as a female stock 
car dri ver and the risks 
involved in her profession 
before about 200 people in 
Mandeville Auditorium. 

According to Guthrie, a 
major difficulty facing women 
race drivers is "a hue and cry 
that women can't do it," She 
noted that women are often not 
taken seriously a nd are not 
"given an- equal opportunity to 
win or fail " in racing. 

"There have been a lot of 
atti tudes a bout how women 
s houldn 't compete with men." 

remarked Guthrie. She said 
that competition among women 
"used to be on a bitching sca le" 
but that women .. are learning 
more about competition." 

At the age of 40, Guthrie has 
competed in more than 175 
recognized races . Her interest 
in cars, she said , bega n when 
she bought a Jacgua r "because 
it was pretty." After nearly 17 
years of racing competition, 
Guthrie does not foresee an end 
to her career in the near future , 
noting " you can't put an exact 
age on it." 

Guthrie said that her biggest 
reward [rom racing has been 
"an exercise in skill ," a-dding 
that a "sense of aliveness" and 
"fi nding you 've given 100 
percent of yourself" have 
further benefited her life. 

Guthrie also discussed the 
role of risks in a woman race 

driver 's life. While women have 
been discouraged from taking 
risks , Guthrie said , men have 
"been cultura lly prepared" for 
them. 

" It's [unny," she added, 
"that the risks of child-bearing 
didn 't seem to count." 

Guthrie noted that at the 
advent of her career people 
orten discouraged her from 
racing. " For a long time," she 
remarked, " it led to a n 
alienation from womanhood." 

"People think all race car 
drivers are suicidal," said 
Guthrie, " but -they're talking 
through their hats." According 
to Guthrie , the only serious 
pSychological study on race car 
drivers indicates that they are 
"significantly less suicidal 
than the rest of the population. " 

Adm'n Requests -Zone Change 
Although Guthrie has often 

met with success, s he has 
endured [ailures as well. "If I 
do poorly," she quipped, "Iturn 
to beer, corn c hips , M and M's, 
and pork rinds ." 

Guthrie will fly to the Ontario 
race track today [or testing 
sessions in preparation for this 
year's Inay 500. Texaco, her 
sponsor in several previous 
races, will again sponsor her in 
the Indy 500 .

A proposal to remove the 
north end of the UCSD campus 
from the protected California 
Coastal Zone is before the 
Regional Coastai Commis-
sion . 

Don Sites, associate vice 
chancellor for facilities 

management, requested the 
change to simplify re-
quirements for development of 
the la nd. 

The present boundary of the 
zone includes the section of 
campus loc a t e d west of

line joining La Jolla Shores

line follows the old path of 
Miramar Road.) This section 
includes most of Muir College, 
as well as Third College a nd 
Central Library. 

Sites ' proposal will not effect 
ripps' Insl,Uute, which is a lso 

in the Coasta1 Zone. 
Sites explained that within 

the zone, " we can't do anything 
without the approval of the 
commission ." In order to 
develop a ny part of the land, 
applications must be filed and 
a ppearance before the coastal 
commission made, in addition 
to similar procedures for other 
local agencies. 

" We have no argument with 
the area on the coast (including 
Scripps) being restricted, but 
it' s hard to see how this area 
has a ny impact on the coast," 
he said . 

The proposal was presented 
at a workshop held by the 
commission on Feb. 8. This 
workshop was not for hearing 
a rguments . only information 
according to Mike Kennedy, 
chief planner for the San Diego 
Regional Coastal Commission. 
Eventually, the suggestions for 
bounda ry changes may be 
included in the required bill 
before the legislature, but first 
they will go through public 

hearings before the regional 
and state commission . The 
first hearing is planned for 
early April, Kennedy said. 

The land was originally 
included in the zone because it 
drains into Penasquitos 
Lagoon , one of only two 
freshwater lagoons in San 
Diego County. The north end o[ 
UCSD i less than one-half o[ 
one percent o[ the total a rea 
draining into the lagoo n, 
according to Pat Collum , 
ca mpus and community 
planner. 

" You have to weigh th; " 
against the lost staff time a nd 
delay in const ruction . which 
can raise costs." Collum said. A 
delay of three to four months , 
like the a ppeal of a finding that 
the library would obstruct 
coasta l views, could increase 
costs .by three to four percent. 
she said . 

Collum said the main concern 
over drainage into Penasquitos 
Lagoon is "si lt ation and 
sedimentation. " This amounts 
to dirt, usually from grading 
land from construction , which 
washed down into the lagoon.

because she has competed in 
[ewer races than in previous 
years. "I've only been in 12

" while in '77 ... there was no

UCSD to Store Oil 
Tank Behind Mayer Hall, Almost 
Finished, Will Hold 240,000 Gallons 

By Kalhl'rine Hafner 
tan Writer 

UC D will be capable of 
storing 240,000 gallons of 
emergency fuel oil within the 
next few weeks, an increase of 
present capacity due to UC 
regulations. The cement box 
next to Mayer Hall, to be 
completed within the next few 
weeks, wil l supply the 
additional 100,000 gallons to 
reach the University System-
wide Policy minimum 20-day 
supply , said Tom Tribble, 
manager of Construction and 
Building Operations , 

"The fuel oil storage is a 
response to a 1974 cutback in 
gas deliveries by SanDiegoGas 
& Electric Co.," Tribble stated. 
" Our ' interruptible' contract 
with them gives them the 
freedom to stop gas deliveries 
to us whenever they want. 
Because deliveries are so 
erratic and unpredictable, we 
must have the alternate oil 
source. " 

According to Tribble, there 
are currently 120,000 gallon~ in 
the tank under the power pla nt. 
Tribble is hopeful that the two 
tanks will be filled to capacity 
with oil [rom Los Angeles in the 
next thirty days. But. he stated, 
at present there is simply no 011 
ava ilable. " We'll just have to 
tand in queue like everyone 

else." 
The project engineer, Bob 

Johnson, sa id that the oil 
storage tanks are funded by the 
Slate o[ California. "S'imilar 
tanks," Johnson said, "are 
being buill on every University 
or California campus." 

According Lo Johnson, the 
newly con8truct~d concrete 
tank is "as watertight us you 
can get." Once the tank dries 
out completely, Johnson stated, 
the cement will be covered with 
[our layers of ,lass mesh and 
asphalt.

University of CaIHornia 
President David Saxon 
announced Friday in Los 
Angeles that he was appointing 
a committee to investigate 
charges that the UC Agri-
cultural extension service 
discriminated against minori-
ties. 

Speaking before the Board of 
Regents , Saxon said that he 
intended to determine if there 
was "any truth " in the 
allegations made by former UC 
nutritionist Robert Bradfield, 
who claims he was fired 
because he complained to the 
federal government that the 
AES was discriminating 
against minorities. 

Bradfield charged that the 
AES, which provides research 

and services to counly farm 
agenCies, was inadequately 
serving the needs of Cali-
fornia's Mexican-Americans. 

Bradfield also claims that he 
was harras ed by the 
University after he tried to 
research the nutritional needs 
of Mexican-Americans. 

In 1977 UC Agriculture 
officials opened Bradfield's 
mail and searched his personal 
file s. Bradfield sued the 
University last spring [or 
invasion of privacy and won 
$95,000. 

It was also learned Friday 
that the Regents, meeting in 
closed session, rejected 
charges made by the American 
Federation of Teachers that the 
University had not properly 
investigated other allegations

Tritons Drop Two Finally Win One 
By Kevi. EllioU 

S&IdI Wrker 
In another of a series of 

disappointing losses the men's 
varsity basketball team 
dropped two gameS' over the 
long weekend. 

On Friday the team traveled 
to Point Loma for their second 
loss to the same team this 
season, 74-88. 

The University of Hawaii 
(Hilo) made astop in San DielO 
on Saturday nigbt and came 
away with an 11-77 victory over 
the home team. 

On a more positive note, the 
Tritons recorded a hard-fOUlbt 
victory over USIU last Tuesday 
night. 

Only a handful of spectators 
showed up at the Main Gym to 
see the Triton varsity 
basketball team avenge an 
earlier loss to USIU by bealing 
the Westerners 84-79. Getting 
an excellent game from their 
front line, the Tritons showed 
their fans that they still can win 
a ball game. 

UCSD led right from the start 
as they jumped into a 1&-8 lead 
and stayed ahead by that 
margin for the rest of the first 
half. Led by January's "Athlete 
of the Month," Lehman 
Brockett, and Bob Frazier the 
Tritons led at halftime 47-38. 

In the second balf UCSD 
maintained a ten-point lead 

untilS minutes to go in the game 
when USIU sUddenly got hot. It 
looked like the Tritons were 
going to pull another one of 
their famous folds as the 
Westerners pulled to within two 
points, but UCSD regrouped 
and got tough in the clutch, 
holding on to win, 84-'19. 

Lee Brockett once again led 
both teams in scoring and 
rebounding, getting 24 points 
and 11 boards. 

Teaming with Brockett to 
give the Tritons their second 
league win was Bob Frazier. 
Frazier played his best game of 
the season as he tallied 16 points 
and snagged 8 rebounds. Close 
behind were Scott Knudsen and 

Stan Hopper with 12 points 
each. 

JV Action 
UCSD's JV Basketball team 

rallied from a big halftime 
deficit last Tuesday night to 
defeat visiting USIU 66-83. 

Getting a balanced scoring 
attack from starlers in the 
second half the Tritons 
overcame the Westerners with 
only a few minutes left and held 
on to win by 3 points. 

USIU, aided by many 
questionable calls by the 
officials, moved into an early 
lead and threatened to blow 
UCSD out of the gym, but the 
Tritons regrouped somewhat 
and trailed at halftime, 41-30. 

tonight." 
Pacing the Triton attack 

were Gardener and Ruane with 
14 points each and Dana Bedard 
with 10.

3 minutes remaining and held

In the opening match of the 

1979 season the intercolle-
giate badminton team was 
edged by Grossmont College, 
HH1, Monday night in the Main 
Gym. 

Men's singles was the Triton 
stroogpoint, as UCSD's men 
overpowered their opponents, 
5-1. The women were handed a 
tough 2-3 defeat in singles 
action but pulled out a 1-1 tie in 
doubles. Men's doubles also 
dropped a close contest, 1-2. 
The weakest Triton per-

{onnance of the evening was a 
1-4 beating in mixed doubles. 

SWIMMING 
The men's swim team 

finished sixth in the UNLas 
Vegas Swim Invitational last 
weekend behind five NCAA 
Division I teams. Diver Ken 
Flagg set a new school 3 meter 
diving record . 

For the swimmers, Joe 
Hernandez placed third and 
fourth in the 100 and 200 yard 
freestyle. Mark Allen took sixth 
in the 100 yard breaststroke. 
Greg McGary swam to a 
seventh in the 200 breast.

Rocks Main Man is No 
Empty Box of Cereal 

By Ted Navla BIIrke 
AnaEaer 

Elvis Costello Is rock's man 
of the moment, and one would 
assume from the frenzied 
reception the full house gave 
him last Sunday at his Fox 
Theatre Jig that the Costello 
ground swell will never ebb. 
But will Costello last? Good 
question. I've been to too many 
concerts where a performer 
does an absolutely dynamite 
performance to an audience 
that seemed to express undying 
loyality, only to be forgotten a 

year later with his albums 
taken off the Ucorice Pizza 
display racks. Is Costello the 
Next Big Thing, someone 
whose music will have a 
profound influence on the po~ 
culture to come, or is he just 
another in a series of 
throwaway performers an 
audience can play with awhile 
and then discard like an empty 
box of corn flakes? Good 
question indeed. 

I'm forclDJ myself to be 
optimistic, though, thinking 
that Costello has enough talent 

Costello, though, doesn't 
have the same initial problem

originally -I'm thinking of Sha 
Na Na and Flash C"dillac -
Costello reshapes these old 
Ideas into fresh combinations, 
oftentimes mixing styles in the 
same song. Musically, the 
familiar sounds incredibly 
fresh. 

What makes Costello's art 
more astounding (or con-
founding) is his knack for 
lyrics. In an age where the 
"important" lyricists of the 
Seventies - Bruce Spriq-
steen, Patti Smith, Warren 
Zevon, Tom Waits - have 
produced a bulk ol work that 
emulates but falls vastly sbort 
of middle-period Dylan and the 
Beat poets before him, Costello 
baa come out of left field and 
caught everyone by surpme. 
His best songs are tightly-
constructed first-person 
narratives, Impressionistic 
glimpses at balled situations 
and the people in them, with 
characters who Costello has 
caught in the variegated aelsof 
Bad Faith and the contingent 
malaise of non-actualization. 

In other words, Costello gives 
the impression that he can tell 
the moment when someone, or 
something, starts laying on the 
bull, and can dissect the 
baloney bulwark with the well-
honed epigram. His persona is 
that of someone who's being 
victimized by others, an overly 
sensitive soul continually on the 
defensive who's developed a 
brilliant capacity to put-down, 
pontificate and get in the last 
word. Through this visage, he 
takes aim at everything, 
whether it be lovers who use sex 
as nothing more than a peer 
group stock commodity 
("Miracle Man," " Living In 
Paradise") , schoolyard bullies 
who grow up to be lamebrained 
thugs ("Two Little Hitlers"). 
media organizations whose 
ability to Pavlov the masses 
borders on fascism ("Radio 
Radio") , or government 
services that bypass their 
humane premise and reduce 
everyone to a number waiting 
in line for minimal and 
impersonal service ("Oliver's 
Army," "Senior Service"). 
Other themes in his material 
are a bit harder to reconcile 
with one's innate Utopianism, 
like murder ("Watching the 
Detectives," "Alison") or 
mysogyny ("I'm Not Angry," 
"Hand in Hand," et al). Any 
number of highly~onsidered 
rock stars have had these traits 
as well, "ike Dylan (still the 
da rliDJ of the New Left a fter all 
these years), Mick Jagger, 
Bowie. In any event, one has to 
take the best with the worse. I 
refuse to get hung-up in New 
Consciousness moralizing over 
Costello's alleged lack of 
humanity. Not to confront his 
world view is to duck the issues 
he brings up.

On the basis or the 
description or the ponder-
ousness of Costello's themes, it 
wouldn't be unusual to assume 
that he would slip into the 
seductive fallacy that since all 
rock lyrics are now poetry, the 
music can take a back seat. 
Costello understands that even 
the most provocative of ideas

Costello passed this rather

hard. 

Costello was an imposing 
figure on the Fox stage. a 
slender, psychotic-looking man 
in a suit with padded shoulders

would bug-eye the audience 
through his owl·frame glasses. 
His expression through the 
night was like someone giving

'Are We Like That?' 

'The Front Page' 
Fast Talks Its 
Way to C~nfusion 

By Jill Louise Bazeley 
Contributinl Edllor 

It is hard to write about the 
Old Globe Theatre's production 
of The Front Page . The plot of 
the play, that of fast-talking 
newspaper reporters covering 
an execution a nd one in 
particular who devises an 
ingenious plan for scooping his 
colleagues is supposedly 
fictitious. But the idea of 
competition, and the newsroom 
atmosphere hits close to home. 
''Are we like that?" I kept 
asking myself. "Are we at the 
Guardian loud -mouthed. 
slovenly bastwns of ruthless 
ambition?" 

Yes, we are to a certain 
degree, but it is all in good fun . 
Our work is a comedy (not to be 
confused with a farce) , just as 
The Front Page is a comedy. 

And as a comedy of some 
stature, The Front Page as 
performed at the Spreckels 
Theatre would be quite funny 
were its blabbery dialogue not 
almost unintelligible. I 
managed to decipher a few 
lines - the ones that are 
repeated often enough to learn 
by rote like, "reform the reds 
with a rope, " but beyond that, 
who knows what the actors 
say? Then again, this may be 
part of director Sandy 
McCallum's realistic treat-
ment, because in our own 
Guardian office, for example, 
communication amid the din is 
nearly impossible. 

The b1ame for all the 
incomprehensible yammering 
goes first to the men who wrote 
the play , Ben Hecht and 
Charles MacArthur, second to 
Mr . McCallum, who timed it, 
and last, to the actors who 
mouthed it. 

I have nothing particular to 
say about any of the ' actors 
except for Patrick J . Kearns, 
who I coutd hear, and who I 
think is a very funny man . 

Steve Lavino' s set for The 
troDt Page is ambiguous. The 
most prominent feature is its 
obliqueness - the proscenium 
is angled and the- newsroom 

grows from stage left to right. 
This is a very promising sort of 
design, for even in J979, oblique 
angles are a bit avant-garde. 
But the promise goes into 
remission when the lights come 
up and reveal a newsroom like 
any other stage newsroom. The 
only really good thing about the 
interior setting is the walls, 
which are rust-stained, and 
colored that awful shade of 
green we are all so familiar 
with - the green that Valium 
would be if Valium were green . 

I must add something here 
about the snack bar at the 
Spreckels Theatre. In my last 
review oC a Globe show at this 
theatre , I noted that the 
chocolate (which I require , 
being a chocoholic) cost $1.00 
per bag. It is now $1.50. An 
outrage. I would like to remind 

tudents that they ca n buy 
student ru h tickets to this play 
for less than it would cost them 
to buy 2 bag of tilis nasty 
(formerly aristocratic) candy . 

Costello 
(Continued from p82e 13) 
about almost as erratically as 
Costello , producing thick 
chords, succinct fills and well-
timed riffs that fleshed out the 
band's sound. The drummer 
and bassist, whose names sadly 
el ude me, are the best rhythm 
section now working, inter-
acti ng with the same verve that 
distinguished Keith Moon and 
John Entwhistle of the Who 
years before. 

The material , mostly from 
the new Armed Forces , was 
received with open arms, but 
the audience was primed for 
older songs. The first chords of 
"Watching Th~ Detectives" 
drove the crowd crazy, At one 
point, Costello discarded his 
guitar and took the mike by 
ha nd and played out the part of 
an alienated lover killing his 
girlfrien4 because sbe watches

Proy st Stewart Delves Into Wilderness 
UCSD should " 

students out of a mplacent 
self-righteous vie v of them-
selves and their reI tion with 
the wilderness by cutting 
through sentimontalism," 
according to Muir rovostJohD 
Stewart who will supervise next 
quarter's completely student-
run Wilderness and Human 
Values class. 

The main purpose of the 
class, which is entering its 
eve nth year. will be to incite 

students to obj ctively debate 
conflicts affecting con-
temporary wilderness and 
human values. 

The class deals with how we 
as human beings relate to 
ourselve and to our environ-
ment. The class further 
concerns itself with how our 
wilderness affects us both 
individually and socially. It 
also examines the impact 
wilderness has had upon us 

Known for its lineup of guest 
speakers, the class also 
supplies the student with fi rst-
hand experience in the 
wilderness through actual trips 
and expeditions.

week-long expedition to the

This year the lecture series 

will offer such peakers as the

talk on energy use responsi-

it~lf solely with one specific

The class is divided into three

human values. Its primary goal 
will be to supply the student 
with an appreciation for the

A philo ophical segment of 
the class consists of discussion 
sections designed for personal 
interaction. The discussion 
leaders will attempt to teach 
the student the ability to debate 
the issues and problems 
involved not only with the 
wilderness but within any 
social context. In addition, the 
student will hopefully be 
motivated to ascertain his own 
moral standards in relation to 
the wilderness and humanity. 

The third segment of the 
class is devoted to giving 
students practical experience

intensive program that the only 
place to cut to make a profit is 
in adult supervisors." 

McBride, though, said that 
the Center spent too much on 
supervisory personnel, adding 
his belief that he thought what 
was " good enough for people 
in the community is good 
enough for here. '.' 

Brown conceded that the 
Center can cut back on 
personnel costs, but only if it 
becomes an established 
program. 

"People forget that we've 
been fighting for existence for 
ten years," she said. " Costs 
could be cut, if, Cor example, 
the Teacher Education 
Program got tied into the 
Center .. . but the last ten years 
we 've been caught up in a year 

we 've been caught up in year to 
year survival." 

Both McBride and Brown 
agreed on one point-that their 
stands on daycare had been 
misi nterpreted by the campus 
population. 

" I'm not against daycare." 
McBride said. " just against reg 
fee funding of daycare." 

"To say that we are aski ng ; 
for $126,000 is a gross 
inaccuracy," Brown said. "We 
just want support for a 
maximum ' student commit-
'ment to daycare." 

Most of the audience of 40 
seemed to have made up its 
mind before entering the 
conference room. 

Daycaresupporters, wearing 
yellow "Yes on Daycare" 
buttons, angrily confronted 
McBride during the debate , 
asking him repeatedly why he 
was "singling out daycare" for 
budget scrutiny, suggesting 
pointedly that his efforts could 
better be spent examining 
other programs on campus. 

Opponents of funding for the 
center were fewer in number, 
but also vocal. One questioner 
told Brown a nd the daycare 
supporters that by supporting 
daycare, they were pushing her 
and other middle class students 
out of the university.

Day claims his approach will 
be best for the quality of the

of any university that new

said. 

The criteria he wants to apply 
in deciding where to make the 
cuts a re: to keep qualified

A chance.to lIDI'k on unusual projects 
Some critical national problems are too important to be influenced by profit or politics. 

This is the reason for the creation of The Aerospace 
Corporation, a not-for-profit company that is part of neither 
industry nor government. 

That detachment allows Aerospace to hold scientific and 
technical considerations foretn$st in applying technology and 
science to solve critical national problems. To preserve 
objectivity, no manufacturing is performed by Aerospace. 

Instead, The Aerospace Corporation is a unique science and 
research source, performing systems planning , systems 
engineering, technical direction and experimentation for several 
National Security agencies. 

High Technologg 
During the· past decade Aerospace was involved in about 600/0 of 

U.S. space launches and over 50% of the payloads orbited . 

EmploUee benefits

Besides space and national security, the company applies its 
expertise to transportation, energy systems, conservation of 
natural resources, law enforcement applications of technology, 
and controlling environmental pollution . 

Aerospace recently contributed to making nuclear power plants 
safe, identifying the flurocarbon threat to Earth's ozone layer, 
designing lightweight body armorfor policemen, and verifying the 
strategic arm~ limitation agreement. 

-Cost shared coverages for disability and survivor income 
-Paid vacations, starting at 3 weeks during the first year 

Personal achievements 
In addition to the Corporation'S diversity and prestige, an 

Aerospace engineer monitors contractor performance and aids 
both customer and manufacturer in seeking solutions to technical 
problems as they arise. This assistance continues during the final 
testing of a new system and, as appropriate, after it is in operation.

ger I Mission Completion .Near 
By Do ... Campion 

Sdeace Edl&or 
Calling the upcoming 

month's Voyager I study of 
Jupiter " the end of years of 
work and dreams and planning 
and frustrations," Dr. Carl 
Christensen of the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, 
Pasadena, spoke here last 
Friday about the NASA space 
probe. 

During the course of the 
lecture, which was presented 
by UCSD's Institute for 
Continued Learning, Christen-
sen talked not only about 
results a nticipated from 
Voyager, but also about the 

remote navigation of the craft 
- the field or ,,:~ expertise. 

Voyager I which was 
launched Sc\>tcmber 5, 1977, is 
currently within 30 million 
miles of the giant planet and is 
scheduled to make its closest 
approach on March 5. 

According to Christensen, 
"Studying Jupiter is important 
for studying the origin of the 
solar system." He explained 
that the planet still appears to 

'contain many oCthe primoridal 
gases - the gases which were 
present at the formation of the 
solar system about four and a 
half billion years ago. 

" I have seen statements that 

Craduating 

there is no solid surface to 
Jupiter, " said Christensen, 
" that it's just a gaseous ball. " 
He expressed skepticism on 
that matter, however, stating 
that although the planet is 
much less dense than the 
Earth, it is 300 limes as 
massive, containing 98% of the 
matter of the solar system 
outside of the sun. 

Superimposing the images 
photographed through eight 
different colored lenses , 
NASA scientists have already 
compiled a collection of color 
pictures of Jupiter and some of 
its 14 moons. They have also 
developed a "stop-action"

movie o{ Jupiter's rotation by 
arranging a series o( several of 
the pictures which were taken 
at regular intervals during the 
large planet 's ten-hour day . 

Christensen expressed the 
surprise experienced by his 
colleagues and himself when 
they first viewed the movie. He 
said. "Clouds in one hemis-
phere (of Jupiter) move in one 
direction, clouds in the other 
hemisphere move in the other 
direction." 

Among the 11 scientific 
experiments aboard the 
Voyager craft are equipment 
for measuring cosmic rays. 
plasma waves, and carrying 
out infra red spectral readings. 

One of the phenomen a 
Christensen mentioned as 
being (ocused on by the 
Voyager mission is the " flux 
tube," or wake o( charged 
particles following the moon 10 
after it passes Jupiter. " 10 
interacts with the magnetic 
field of Jupiter, c' Christensen 
explained. The moon, which is 
slightly larger in size than the 
planet Mercury, often drags 
behind it a tra il of brightly 
glowing matter. The flux tube is 
sometimes seen (rom earth 
with the aid o( high-power 
telescope . 

Navigating the spacecraft 
through the vast expanse of 
space has provided some,

scientists. According to 
Christensen, "Jupiter .. .is five 
times as (ar away from the sun 
as the Earth is. Saturn is ten 
times as far. " 

Because Jupiter is so far 
(rom Earth , radio instructions 
sent to Voyager take about half 
an hour to reach It. Another 
haif-hour is required then to 
wait to determine whether or 
not the craft has properly 
responded to thp t'Ommands. 

Once Voyag( '1 J ,as surveyed 
Jupiter, it will d~pend on what 
Christensen referred to as 
"gravity assist" to push it out 
toward Saturn. According to 
Christensen. gravity assist is 
the use of the gravitational 
attraction of a planet " like a 
giant slingshot" to shoot the 
spacecraft out. away (rom that 
planet. 

Voyagl'!' I is scheduled to 
reach the planet Saturn 
sometime in November of 1980. 
After viewing that planet, the 
craft will be shot beyond the 
limits of the solar system.

Clarification 
The Statement Against Day Care Funding included in 
the Day Care Voters Pamphlet and attributed to 
Donald E. Strebel was reprinted from the Los Angeles 
Times (Saturday, December 9, 1978, Part II, page 5) 
by the Day Care Information Board. 

The ubmission of the tatement by Don Strebel was in 
re pon e to a reque t by the Day Care InforQ1ation 
Board for a tatement against Registration Fee 
FulViing. This request was made because only 
tatements in favor of funding had been submitted and 

the Board ~Tanted to provide a balanced discussion of 
the is ues.
