UC Considers Policy For Firing 
'Grossly Incompetent' Professors 
By CATHERINE DILLE 
News EdilOI 

The UC Academic Senate task 
force is meeting to determine 
whether or not the UC should set 
guidelines for removing "grossly 
incompetent" academic faculty 
from their positions. 

According to David Krogh, 
assistant to the chairperson of th 
UC's Academic Senate, a proposal 
regarding the termination of em-
ployment for incompetent faculty 
was passed by the faculty senate at 
UC Berkeley last spring. 

Krogh went on to say that the 
question of competency is now 
being addressed by a University-
wide panel. 

"The Academic Senate task 
force appointed a seven member 
task force last spring" to consider 
the subject, he said. 

The task force , including fac-
ulty members from most UC cam-
puses, met Tuesday for prelimi-
nary discussions, Krogh said. 

"Faculty members are expected 
to teach and research," Krogh 
explained. 

"If such a policy passed, a very 
small number of grossly incompe-
tent faculty would be affected," he 
said. 

According to Krogh, the com-
mittee has not yet established a 
time-frame for completing their 
work. 

The question of when to termi-
nate employment of an incompe-
tent professor has, according to 
Katja Lindenberg, professor of 
chemistry and past chairperson of 
the UCSD Academic Senate, 
"floated around in the system for 
many years." 

Lindenberg also feels that only 
a "handful" of UCSD professors 
would be affected, if any. 

Lynn Harris, administrator for

agreed that the new proposal would

their evaluations. 
He explained that both academic 

creativity and teaching are evalu-
ated in the review process. 

"If there is a zero increase in 
either one of the categories, no 
increase is advised. One doesn't 
just discover [that a faculty mem-
ber is incompetent] , it is a cumula-
tive affair," Stem said. 

Termination of employment of 
incompetent professors has been 
discussed at academic personnel 
committee meetings, according to 
Stem. 

"There was general approval of 
the recommendation made by the 
Berkeley Academic Senate on 
grossly incompetent academic 
faculty," he said. 

Stem also said he considered 
the Berkeley Academic Senate's 
actions to be "a gentle approach to 
a very difficult problem." 

There is not general acceptance 
throughout the UC system as to 
what the standard should be, how-
ever. Stem pointed out that the 
UCLA Academic Senate is op-
posed to the decisions made at

"If they fall down in both to the 
extent that they are considered 
'grossly incompetent,' " then the 
newly-determined criteria would 
apply. 

"I wouldn ' t say it will be pub-
lish or perish," he said, but the new 
policy would help determine the 
extent to which the University will 
tolerate an incompetent faculty 
member. 

"We don't have professors who 
[could be considered grossly in-
competent]. We perform evalu-
ations regularly," she said. 

Herbert Stem, professor emeri-
tus in the biology department and 
chairperson of the UCSD Com-
mitteeon Academic Personnel, also 
agreed, calling the problem of in-
competent faculty "very minimal."

To 'Fighting Word'Regulations 

Krogh estimates that only a few 
UC faculty would be affected by 
any policy the committee might 
adopt. 

According to Stern, UCSD 
operates on a "merit increase" 
system where professors undergo 
mandatory reviews at least once 
every three years, and increases in 
salary and position are awarded to

The Koala and the New

pressed their views on the new UC 
'fighting words' policy yesterday. 

The policy, which allows disci-

plinary action against students who 
use 'fighting words' to harass oth-
ers, is an addition to the UC Stu-
dent Conduct policy instituted by 
UC President David Gardner on 
Sept. 21.

'Rubber Stamping' of Committee 
Appointments Debated By A.S. 

According to Student Conduct 
Coordinator Nicholas Aguilar, the 
policy not only concerns verbal 
confrontation, but the written word 
as well . Consequently, all UC 
campus publications can be held 
accountable for any content that 
violates the policy. 

New Indicator collective mem-
ber David Aronson said that "as far 
as a collective editorial policy goes, 
we will completely ignore it.

The confirming of A.S. com-
mittee appointments was the focus 
ofa40 minute debate in last night's 
A.S. Council meeting. 

The debate over whether coun-
cil post appointees were being 
given "rubber stamp approval" 
caused the A.S. meeting to finish 
long past its scheduledconc1usion. 

The A.S. Council appointees 
have been selected by a personnel 
committee consisting of six people. 
. The appointees were then ques-
tioned and screened by both Wong 
and the committee, which votes on

whether or not to approve the ap-

The controversy arose when 
some members voted for appoint-
ees they did not know personally, 
and who were not in attendance. 

Some council members pointed 
out that those who were not on the 
committee had no time to familiar-
ize themselves with the proposed 
appointees. 

A.S. Council member Larry 
Becker abstained from voting on 
members who were not present at 
the meeting, saying "I am not a 
'rubber stamp.' I have abstained 
from voting on anyone I didn't 
know."

Councilmember Nick Spiess 
said the personnel committee's 
function was to select qualified 
people for committee posts. 

"There's no reason to have a 
personnel committee if this is going 
to come up" in the meeting, Spiess 
said. 

The Council debated whether 
or not to forestall the appointments 
of all those not attending the meet-
ing until the following week and 
finally decided to table the appoint-
ments' as the meeting was running 
overtime. Twenty-two appoint-
ments were made for various 
committee posts before the item

comes to public figures," said 
Aguilar.

'Hot, Sexy and Safer Week' 
Sizzles With Suzi Landolphi 
By NICOLA WHITEHEAD 
Gllordian JllIern 

Using humor as her weapon, 
comedianSuzi Landolphi managed 
to cut through boring facts and 
figures to educate her audience 
about safe sex in her "Hot, Sexy, 
and Safer" presentation Monday 
night in the Price Center Ballroom. 

The program was part of the 
A.S.-sponsored "Hot, Sexy and 
Safer Week." 

According to Landolphi, two 
college students out of one thou-
sand test positive for AIDS. 

The odds of those two students 
limiting their sexual activities to 
each other are low. It takes from 
six weeks to six months, and per-
haps years, for the AIDS antibod-
ies to develop in order to be de-
tected in tests. In the meantime, 
the virus remains in their blood 
and can be transmittec:., she said. 

The UCSD Guardian 

One aspect of AIDS that Lan-
dolphi addressed is the presence of 
AIDS outside of the homosexual 
and IV drug using communities. 

Landolphi also pointed out that 
while most college students think 
they are isolated from the IV drug 
user community, two million 
people use steroids, possibly shar-
ing needles because they don't 
consider themselves at risk. 

Felix ZuniplGuardioll 
Suzi Landolphi's "Hot, Sexy, and Safer" presentation was held 
on Monday in the Price Center Ballroom. 

"That virus doesn't give a shit 
what orientation you are. It's not a 
homosexual experience that puts 
you at risk with the AIDS virus, 
it's asexual activity ... so what we 
have to start doing is talk a little 
more clearly about [high AIDS 
risk] activities and a lot less about 
our orientations," she said. 

"You have the opportunity to 
keep your generation HIV free!" 
Landolphi asst:rted. 

Landolphi ' s message was that 
communication, honesty, and trust 
should lead to safer and better sex 
between partners. She feels that 

people should be comfortable with 
their bodies and their partners' 
bodies before intercourse. 

"If you can't have the lights on 
you shouldn ' t be having inter-
course," she said. 

Landolphi brought volunteers 
on stage for "dirty dancing" les-
sons and a demonstration of how 
to put on a condom using one

According to Stem, If such a

the UCSD vice chancellor of aca-
demic affairs would have to take 
action if a faculty member were 

found to have a cumulatively poor 
record. 

Stem said that the vice chancel-
lor would have records of all for-

be dismissed?" he said.

Gross Incompetence 
Firing Bad Professors 
The University of California is considering a proposal to set 

guidelines for firing or disciplining "grossly incompetent" ten-
ured professors. This proposal, not surprisingly, has resulted in 
screams of prOlests from many of the 6,700 tenured professors on 
the nine UC campuses. 

Such a propo al pas ed the UC Berkeley faculty senate, but is 
opposed by many UCLA professors. The UC has formed a 
university-wide panel to study the idea. 

The basic premise of the proposal - that professors who are 
unable to function effectively in both re earch and teaching 
should be removed from universities - is a good one. The final 
policy needs to be carefully designed, however, and should take 
into account the more common problem of professors whose 
research is exemplary, but whose teaching skills are minimal or 
absent. 

One of the primary reasons the UC is considering guidelines 
concerning gross incompetence is because of worries that when 
mandatory retirement rules disappear in 1993, there will be some 
professors who hang on long past their prime. The abolishment 
of mandatory retirement - a good idea - will occur because of 
a 1986 federal law. 

Another reason for the proposal is that in 1986 the UC began 
formal performance reviews for professors every five years. This 
brought several cases of incompetence to the attention of UC 
officials. 

There's no question that professors should have the security of 
tenure, freeing them to make controversial statements and be 
iconoclal>ts. Eroding tenure could be a blow to academic free-
dom. However, some mechanism must exist to deal with gross 
incompetence. 

In the case of older professors, the policy would not be as 
harsh . Its application would almost certainy consist largely of 
forcing them into retirement. With younger professors, the 
situation is more delicate. 

Stripping a professor of tenure effectively ends his or her 
career, which is probably a large part of the reason the UC has 
never done so, and is reluctant to do so even in the case of former 
UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Robert A. Huttenback, a convicted 
embezzler. But a set policy would allow professors to be pres-
sured to resign. 

Several changes should be made in the proposal before it is 
implemented. First, the wider question of priorities must be 
addressed. This brings up the old conflict between research and 
teaching, which every university wrestles with. Research is 
vitally important, but if a professor is a totally incompetent 
teacher, he or she shouldn 't be required to spend time in the 
classroom. In fact, such a professor should not be allowed to 
teach even if he or she wishes to. 

Similarly, and more important, tenure should not be withheld 
from an excellent instructor who is deficient in research. A large 
part of a university's reputation comes from its research, but an 
equally large part comes from the success of its graduates. This, 
in tum, is a result of the quality of its instructors. 

The policy should be carefully designed to allow a panel of 
professors, administrators and students to apply pressure to a 
professor to leave the university if he or she is incompetent in 
both teaching and research, and to curtail either teaching or 
resex'ch if he or she is deficient in one of these tasks. 

The policy should also have a system of appeals and checks to 
minimize the danger of tenure being withdrawn because a profes-
sor is making controversial statements. Tenured professors 
should still be difficult to fire, but a clearly defined policy would 
allow professors to be treated f~irly and would allow UCs to be 
free of those who are grossly incompetent. 

Commentary 
How Many Pairs of Shoes Does Benson Have? 

By EILEEN HENRY, Classified Manager 
Steve Ben on's canoon in the 

Oct. 12 Guardian surprised me. 
He ridiculed President Comon 
Aquino as a woman without a 
heart because the dead Ferdinand 
Marcos is now a man without a 
country. 

Benson's memory must be very 
short. Marcos stole millions of 
dollars from his countrymen and 
country women, and there is strong 
evidence that he is personally 
responsible for opposition leader 
Benito Aquino's assassination. 

Benson also seems to have for-
gotten that the assassinated Aquino 
was Corazon's husband. 

What's funny?

Affirmative Action Editorial Misguided 
Editor: 

The Guardian's editorial 
against affirmative action (Guard-
ian, Oct. 23) has a major contex-
tual flaw. 

It rests upon the claim that 
programs aimed at increasing 
minority opportunity undermine 
the meritocratic and color-blind 
ideal of American institutions such 
as universities (ie. poor and quali-
fied whites being denied admis-
sion solely due;o skin color). TIle 
truth is that such ideals have long 
been undermined, not by liberal 
do-gooders, but rather by conser-
vative and privileged people. 

Does anybody know what spe-
cial criteria were considered by 
Indiana's law school when they 
admittedJ. Danforth Quayle? How 
many white students will take 
advantage of connections or rec-
ommendations of family friends 
to achieve entrance into the busi-
ness world or a university? TIle 
term "networking" comes to mind. 
If affirmative action is viewed in 
this wider context, then it becomes 
apparent thata non-quotaprogram 
is a good idea at all levels of soci-
ety. In the face 0000 years of not-

so-subtle racism, which continues 
today, as The Guardian admits, it

that they are welcome too. 

As someone who has tried to 
teach underprivileged inner-city 
kids, I take offense at the charge of 
a subtle racism that leads teachers 
to have lower expectations for 
blacks. 

The fact of the maner is that the 
white middle and upper classes 
have decided that public schools 
aren't good enough for their kids . 
and that those left behind don't 
deserve their support. 

A simple example is my home-
town. rn 1974, the federal courts 
ordered the city of Boston to de-
segregate their public schools by 
busing. 

Many whites opposed it on the 
principle of neighborhood schools 
for all kids. Sounds good, right? 
They then proceeded to send their 
kids to parochial schools in the 
suburbs, i.e. even farther away. So 
much for principle. 

The problems of race are far 
graver than The Guardian'S edi-
torial implies. To suggest that 

affirmative action programs im-
pede progress is another example 
of blaming the victim, and i ludi-
crous. It is one short step to saying 
that the editorial staff would feel 
advantaged if they were born black 
in America (as Donald Trump did 
recently). 

In fact, Ronald Reagan 's 
America has turned the struggle 
for a color-neutral society on its 
head. TIle hostility of his admini-
stration to civil rights for blacks 
was amply demonstrated when he 
demanded states' rights to an all-
white Philadelphia, MiSSissippi 
crowd in 1980. 

Does anybody else hear an 
historical echo? Perhaps, in this 
context, we can see why black 
leaders defend existing programs 
with such vigor. It is one of the 
few places today where the ideal 
of a color-blind society is still 
upheld and acted upon. 

Unfortunately, it is also the 
ground they, and others, have been 
forced to defend from people like 
The Guardian's editorial board, 
who are no doubt well intentioned, 
but part of a larger whole.

Thursday, October 26, 1989 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 
------

Do you feel that UCSD is prepared for an earthquake? 

Maybe surviving an initial quake 
but the problems that come after 
are so much more tragic (for 
example food and ware ' 
supplies) - I don't know if 
UCSD is equipped to handle 
that. 

don't know if the campus is 
structurally ready. I would think 
so. I think people are aware 
that it can happen anytime and 
they accept that it can happen. 
I'm ready and I don't worry about 
it because there's nothing I can 

I really don 't know what 
precautions have been taken. 
I've heard rumors that some 
buildings [are] unsafe in 
earthquakes. I'd like to think 
that precautions have been 
taken but I have no way of 

I think generally it is because 
the buildings are newer and 
they've had more protection 
because they are more 
modern.

Yes, it looks pretty sturdy and 
there's a lot of open spaces for 
people to go. I think it's 
prepared.

Russian 
Emigres 
Exhibit Work 
at Mandeville 

By RE EE LEWIS 
Staff Writer 

Twenty-three works of art by conceptual 
Russian emigre artists Vitaly Komar and 
Alexander Melamid are currently on exhibit 
at the Mandeville Galle!)'; 

The e:\hlbllion \\ 111 run until Dec. 10, 
with an opening recept ion at the gallery on 
Oct. 27 from 6 to p.m . lu qhe galle!)'s un-
offIcial contribution to the Sun Diego \ rts 
Fe'tl\al. accord ing to Gerr: McAlister. dl-
n:ctor of the Mande \ ille Gal1e!)'. he ab o 
saId that the fe~tival needed to incl ude some 
contem pora!) art . 

Komar and Melamld met in 1963 in the 
morgue at Moscow's Insti tute for Phy ical 
Culture, ",hile attending an anatomy draw-
Ing class. In the early ~eventies they in-
vented a new type of art together called 
"Sots' Art. whose name comes from the fi rs t 
syllable of the Russian word for SOCIali st. 
Sot Art combined Pop Art . \.\ hich the art ists 
had een in Amencan art maga7ines. with 
stylistic features of SOCIalist Realism. Smce 
that time they have worked together exclu-
ively. 

In 1974. Komar and Melam id were ex-
pelled from the Moscow Union of Artists 
for "distortion of Soviet reality and devia-
tion from Socialist Realism." This expul-
sion meant that they could no longer rent 
studio space, buy art supplies easily. or offi-
cially exhibit their work. 

After only two exhibitions of their work 
m 1975. one of which was raided by Soviet 
Police. word about their art began to spread 
10 other countries. Four ) ears later. Komar 
and Melamid moved to ew York City. 
where they now li ve as U.S. citi zens. 

Among the works o f art exhibited at the 
Mandevi lle Gal1ery. all of which were made 
between 1985 and 1988. are eight paintings 
and multimedia works from the artists ' re-
cen! Bergen Point Brass Foundry Series. 
The series depicts the Ii fe and labor of blue 
collar workers in Bayonne, New Jersey. 

Yitaly Komar said that they were drawn 
the Bergen Point Brass Foundry because 
they wanted to "depict real Amenca." 

"We were looking [at] many different 
factories around New York and we saw 
many of them, " Komar said. "The factory at 
Bayonne was much more aesthetically bet-
ter. It was more beautiful because of the 
color of molten bronze and the nice and 
beautiful people [who worked there] . They 
are really heroes of everyday life. 

"The color of the sunset around the fac-
tory [was] so close to molten bronze. It was 
just beautiful." 

When asked if he felt that freedom of 
artistic expression in the Soviet Union had 
changed since he and Melamid were living 
and working there, Komar said, "it's not 
freedom of arti stic expression, it's now more 
the freedom to sell artistic expression. Eve-
rybody has always had the freedom to do 
anything, but not for sale [of art] ." 

Komar and Melamid will also be giving a 
lecture on Nov. 9 at 7:30 p.m. in the Man-
deville Auditorium titled "Komar and Mel-
amid: About Themselves." There is no 
admis ion charge for either the exhibi tion or 
the lecture.

Being Un-fashionable is Fashionable at UCSD 

• Photos by Corey Matthew Lidschin 
Students at UCSD take a laid-back approach to clothes. Sure, the excuse is easy: we're 

intellectuals with other things on our minds Iike- the beach. 
So, some of us wear sweats all the time. but they're convenient. We can work out with the 

weights, get all weaty and smelly , and still be able to drop in to our Economics class and look 
somewhat fas hionable. 

Of course, there are the socially aware among us-- someof us have chosen to make a 
statement with our clothes, by wearing all black-- everyday. 

And then there are those among us who couldn't find a pair of matChing socks if their lives 
depended on it. But what the hell-- it's Southern California. 

We may never grace the cover 0 f GQ or Vogue, but at least we don't come to school naked. 

Holly rests that 
intellectually challenged 

mind by grabbing a

Soviet 
Posters 
Displayed 
Exhibit Shows View 
of Russian Life 

By MARK BUBIEN 
Contibuling Writer 

A red star. stamped on the hand, 
gained one entry into the exhibit. 
A symbol of Soviet society, there 
was a time when one would be 
damned if caught in possession of 
such an icon. Yet the symbol was 
appropriately chosen, for it repre-
sented the openness, the glasnost, 
pervading the event. 

"Posler Art of the Soviet Un-
ion : A Window Into Soviet Life," 
an exhibit of native Russian poster 
art to hang at the La Jolla Musuem 
of Contemporory Art from Octo-
ber 22 to January 7. 

The opening was scheduled to 
present two things: the art itself, 
and a guest of honor from the Soviet 
Union. 1be art arrived, but the 
guest of honor did not: Oleg Sa-
vostiuk was detained in Moscow 
for unspecified reasons. 

Philip Risbeck, a friend of Sa-
vostiuk and head of the graphic 
design department at the Colorodo 
State University, clarified why 
Savostiuk was chosen guesl of 
honor. Risbeck said posts Savos-
tiuk's include include Secretary of 
the Union of Soviet Artists, num-
bering 18,000 members, a profes-
sor at the Academy of Art in 
Moscow, and President of the 
Painters of Moscow. 

Savostiuk handled the "Soviet 
end" of things: attaining permis-
sions, choosing posters and arrang-
ing shipment. 

Though Savostiuk was absent 
from the exhibit's opening, two 
lectures presented themes ranging 
from Soviet life to environmental 
issues to the style of poster art. 

Risbecksaid most, ifnot all, of 
the exhibit conveys a written mes-
sage, sometimes scrawled in a 
comer, sometimes boldly domi-
nating the work. Risbeck called 
the style typography, the arrange-
ment of printed matter upon a 
medium. 

Typographical messages range 
from the practical , ("Family! Let 
there be happiness in it! And let 
work, the rearing of children, love, 
and peace in your home contribute 
to it. to) to the political ("Pereslroika 
has been going on a long time, but 
the labyrinth of instructions keeps 
growing."). 

Risbeck said the political post-
ers especially manifest the sense 
of unhindered openness. 

Risbeclc.saidthedisplayofmany 
of the blatant, fervent expressions 
would have been impossible prior 
to June 1988, the date he marks as 
the beginning of glasnost. 

Risbeck said Ihe contrast be-
tween posters on both sides of the 
glasnostbarrierisobvious. In 1986, 
a poster states, "Hurrah for the 
Soviet Soldier," while, in 
1989posters read: "Perestroika, 
Glasnost, Acceleration, Democ-
racy."

Men's Soccer Still Alive for Playoffs 

Tritons Drop Biola, 3-1 
By DAVE LINDSTROM 
Contributing Writer 

According to Triton Head 
Coach Derek Armstrong. yester-
day's crowd at the men's soccer 
game was the smalle t he'd seen at 
a UCSD game ince 1983. 

Small crowd or 'not. his team 
came back from an early deficit 
and won its second game in a row. 
The 3-1 victory over NAIA Biola 
University keeps the Tritons in 

contention for a postseason berth. 
UCSD asserted itself in the 

early-going. but it was the Eagles 
who struck first with a goal at the 
17 minute mark. 

The Tritons were on the offen-
sive when the Eagles punched the 
ball down field. With a three-on-
two advantage. Biola 's first shot 
was blocked by Triton goalkeeper 
Brain Siljander. but Eagle Sean 
Coppage managed to get the re-
bound and score the lone goal for 

the visitors. 
It was nearly 20 minutes later 

when UCSD finally got on the 
board. 

The Tritons' first goal came off 
the foot of Mike Alberts at 35:55. 
With UCSD driving near the end 
of the first half. Alberts found the 
net again after a comer kick at 
42:31 for what proved to be the 
winning goal. 

Alberts. a sophomore, had been 
moved up to the frontline fromthe 
midfield for Wednesday's game. 
Armstrong said that he had been 
looking to move Alberts up to a 
forward posi ton - a move which 
turned out to be a success as Al-
berts helped spark the Tritons to 
victory. 

In the second half, the Tritons 
added an insurance goal at 56:58. 
The final goal of tbe game came 
via the head of Chris Hyde after a 
pa s from Chris Hanssen. 

The victory upped the Tritons' 
record to 10-5-3 with two games 
remaining in the regular season. 
Both games - one against the 
University of Redlands and the 
other again t Loyola Marymount 
University - will be hosted by 
UCSD and are crucial concenring 
the Tritons' postseason chances. 

Armstrong explai ned that 
numerous unexpected injuries and 
graduation losses have forced him 
(0 play a younger team, but he 
appeared confident that the team 

T hursday, October 26, 1989 

would make the playoffs. Marc Schnapper and the Tritons held up Biola by a 3-1 count.

PHIL'S ANALYSIS ... It's due time to give the UCSD 
men 's water polo team a little credit. 1 mean, this squad 
might be the best intercollegiate team on this campus. 
Period. All you have to do is check out a practice -let 
alone a game - to realize this. So you say that a 15-11 
record isn't a big deal? Consider this: the Tritons are 
ranked ninth in the country, not in Division III, not in 
Division IT, but in the Open Division where every team 
ahead of them is a scholarship school - schools like 
UCLA, Cal State Long Beach. Pepperdine, USC, UC Irv-
ine, UCSB, Stanford, and UCBerkeley. These,myfriends, 
are not Division III schools. And another thing - UCSD 
beat UCSB on Sunday and has played close games with 
nearly all of these schools in its losses against them this 
year. Riding the crest of their recent upset win over UC 
Santa Barbara, the Tritons have new confidence and will 
give Berkeley a challenge ... and might even come away 
with a victory. PHIL requires you to .. .

A Fairy Tale 

Hockey in California? 
Yes folies , hockey does exist here in 

sunny Ca6fornia. h's not a figment of 
your imagination when your truckin' to 
class and you see some guy or gal 
walUn' by with a hockey slick. n does 
seem sIl'ange though. n's also not true 
that hockey came 10 Caiforr.ia the day 
'The Greatest One- was lraded 10 the 
Kings. Heck. we've had an oulsIand· 
ing hockey program here before 
Grelzky's hIaey Janet Jones was 
born. 

Yet it does seem strange that our 
program here at the Big U has been so 
successful over the years, You know 
that hockey is mainly a sport domi· 
nated by the frigid part 01 this country, 
back east foil. They are born with a 
hookey stick in their hands. 

But why than do we have over 100 
hookey teams participa*'g in our pr0-
gram when we are born with a surf· 
board in our hands? Floor hodcey 
happens to be the fourth largest sport 
here at UCSD in participation. I'd be 
wiling to bet that hodIey as a sport is 
abou15Oth In popularity inCaifomia. 

But Why? 

I have some theories. In order they 
are: 
1.) Who C818S. 
2.) There are too many Easterners 
rnoYing out 10 God's land. 
3.). Ea~ don't scare East· 
erners from moving out here any. 
more. 
4.) Carolyn HoHman runs the pr0-
gram. 
5.) Budwaiter is consumed at high 
IeYeIa and 1he SUlenI8 think they're 
playing fooIIlaI. 
6.) Tommy Tucker next wants to 
build a hockey rink. 

You talleyOlJ'Choice, I knowminel 
But if you aren't playing hock8y in 

the Rec:kanIome this quarter you 1/8 
nissing a heU 01 a good time. I 
suggest you get at team together for 
nexl Winter quarter and get out on the 
ice. It's a great Nme and a great 
worlloutll 

Over-the-Une Goes Over the Top 
n was inlended to be a trial horse program that might attract some new stu· 

dents to the ucso ~ program, but H quick analysis of early returns are any 
indcation, the sport of Over· The-Une may be here 10 stick around some. 

With 24 teams quickly gobbing up the aflotled league spaces, Over· The-line 
made its marl<. in a twy this pas! month and has appaIQIl\tt oontinued its initial 
popularity trend on the fietd as wefl. 

raditionaJIy a beadl game in the San Diego area cUing the summer months, 
OTL was introduced on ~ this year as a more convenient recreational ac· 
tivity that students might embrace. \Wh the sport growing by leaps and bounds 
all over Southem CaiIornia, Nevada, and Arizona, UCSD 1M oIficials figured why 
not give H a shot. HaM way through the season, it appears thai OlL just might 
make it on the traditional sports menu ofIered by UCSD IntramJrals each year.

HI .. LO: BOOT FACTOR 4 
This next game was developed in direct response to criticism 

that beer games are too complicated for the hopelessly drunk. Well. 
for those never-say-die partiers. H i-Lo is the answer. 

Hi-Lo requires only that players be able to recognize shapes 
and colors. It is played with a deck of cards divided evenly between 
the competitors. Each player turns over one card at a time. Those 
with low cards drink for every card higher than theirs. 

For example. if three people are playing. the player with the 
lowest card drinks twice. the player with the middle card drinks 
once. and the player with the highest card does not drink at all. Ties 
are settled by suit: in order. Spades. Hearts. Diamonds. Clubs. 

If this does not sound too complicated. even for the incredi-
bly trashed. just wait till they try to shuffle. This task usually proves 
much too difficult. and the games ends.

the San Diego show is an aspect of

history. photography. 

From Oct. 22 to Nov. 19. the 
Museum of Photographic Arts 
(MOPA) in Balboa Park presents 
a show entitled "An Insight Into 
Contemporary Soviet Pho togra-
phy, 1968-1988." 

The origin of the show was 
January 1988. when Marie Fran-
coise Georges. of the Comptoir De 
La Photographie in Paris. began a 
nine-month exploration of works 
by young Soviet photographers 
from Mosco w , Leningrad and 
Vilnius. Selecting approximately 
150 pieces from 39 well-known. as 
well as up-and-coming. artists she 
set out to introduce the tabooed 
subculture of the Soviet Union to 
the international art world. 

Photography is not highly ac-
knowledged in the Soviet Union.

Photographers have fo rmed into a 
separate subculture because of a 
common bond of being socially 
and culturally excluded from other 
art forms. 

In a nation that does not em-
pha ize advertising ana show busi-
ness. photography has no com-
merc ial use and threatens the soc i-
el y with the emergence of these 
trades. Thus the artists do no t have 
a union. training or a market in

well as those living on the absolute 
margins of society. 

"Glasnost has encouraged pho-
tographers to experiment and play 
with radical ideas." MOPA Ex-
ecutive Director Arthur Gilman 
said . "Some photographers create 
more or less traditional genre stud-
ies. while others are openly defiant 
of conventions and have begun to 
wrestle with a hearty expresssion-
ism."

A Slice Of Life 
From Two Societies 

By Melinda Hamilton 
Hiatus Intern 

The ultimate task of photojournalism is to turn the ordinary into 
the cxtraordinary . rake a piece 01 everyday life 'lnd make it somcthing 
special. Photojournalist Rick Smolan has done just that. with the 
help of editor David Cohen. by gath ering some of the world's hest 
photogr'lphers and challenging them to capture one day in the life of 
a part of the world. a project which has resulted in eight bestselling 
books. 

Project organizers Cohen and Smolan brought a multimedia pres-
entalion of two of these book . A Day In the Life of Amenca and A Day 
in the Life of the Soviet Union, to ManJevi lle Auditorium Tuesday 
night. 

After producing five previous "Day In the Life" projects, Cohen 
and Smolan decided to attcmpt the unprecedented: shoot a day in the 
life of the Soviet Umon. ln acountry where taking a picture ofa bridge 
constitutes a violation of national ecurity, trying to get 100 photog-
rnphers, both from Soviet bloc and We, tern countries, imo the most 
restricted place provided a great challenge to Smolan anJ Cohen. 

Smolan and Cohen then approacheJ officials at the oviet Em-
b,\ssy in Wa~hington, suggesting the possibility of a book ab lit the 
Soviet Union "The people at the [Soviet) Embassy would Itsten 
pol.tcly. but we n.:ver got the go-ahead," Smolan said. 

In the fall of 1986. Novosti. the oviet pre s agency, invited Co-
hen and Smolan to Jiscu ' the project. Severa l months of negotiation 
followed. Development of the film and the number of We tern pho-
tographers that would be allo wed to , hoot presented the biggest 
problems, accord ing to Cohen. Cohen believes the advent of Soviet 
General Secretary MIkhail Gorbachev'sglasnost pohcy was the maIO 
factor In allowing them to contmue with the project. 

After three yea rs of negotiation. Cohen and Smolan brought their 
staff to Moscow. One hundred photographers. 50 from Soviet bloc 
countries and 50 from Western countries, had been chosen from over 
500 app licants. The Soviets granted these photographers unprece-
dented access to previously restric ted areas such as the cosmonaut

Photos 
Continued from page 2 

Most of the ph tographs ex-
hibited are in black and white, 
since color film is not readily avail-
able in the Soviet Union. 

Since our culture differs so 
greatly from that of the Soviet 
Union, I would urge anyone to go 
see the entire Soviet Arts Festival. 
There is sure to be something to 
see in this exhibit which exi ts by 
virtue of the photographer' con-
viction and moral obligations. 
MOPA invites you to open your 
eyes to a new perspective. 

For further information, 
call 239-5262. 

Eggs 
Continued from page 7 
issue. As the mayor put it, they 
talked about their families, the 
weather, everything but the eggs. 
Finally Rodimtseva agreed to lend 
eight eggs, seven for each of Mayor 
O'Connor's sisters and one espe-
cially for her mother. O'Connor 
expressed gratitude to everyone 
involved with the exhibit, espe-
cially Forbes for his generosity in 
lending the eggs. Notonlyare they 
going to be shown in San Diego, 
but will tour the Soviet Union 
later. O'Connor said, "I had the 
dream, but a dream does not be-
come reality unless there's some-
one to implement that dream." 

All history aside, the eggs are 
incredibly beautiful and well worth 
the drive to Balboa Park. There 
are 25 eggs in the collection, and it 
seems as if each one is more intri-
cate and breathtaking than the 
next. It is amazing that so much 
detail could go into something so 
small. The colors and splendor are 
overwhelming. Words truly can-
not describe what needs to be seen. 

As you walk into the museum 
there is a quote from the museum 
director, Steven Brezzo, that is an 
eloquent summation of the ex-
hibit. It reads, "It is both ironic 
and revealing that what eventu-
ally became the dazzling symbol of 
the opulent and resplendent era is, 
in its purest form, one of nature's 
most unadorned and perfect com-
ponents. From the dawn of re-
corded time, the egg was deter-
mined to be the symbol of birth 
and ultimate resurrection." 

The feeling behind this exhibit, 
and the whole Soviet Arts Festi-
val, is that it is time for a meshing 
of our two cultures. All of the 
dignitaries conveyed their happi-
ne s at the new friendships that 
had evolved because f this proj-
ect, and promised thi was only 
the beginning. 

They also expressed how it is up 
to our generation to continue in 
this direction. Rod imtseva ex-
plained, "The most important 
thing about the festival i that it's 
dedicated to the future, especially 
the future of the children. Friend-
ship between the United States 
and the Soviet Unton will be in 
the hands of the children." 

The Faberg egg exhibit will 
run until Jan. 7,1990. Theexhibit 
i ' open from 11 a.m. t 5 p.m. Ad-
mission is $5 for adults. Advan e 
tl kcts are availahlc at the box of-
fice.
