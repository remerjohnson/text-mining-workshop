From carte blanche to cardboard 
The history 
of UCSD's 
archi tecture 

The architectural complexion of 
UCSD i in a constant state of flux, 
re ponding in concrete and gla s to the 
fiscal and environmental needs of the 
moment. Lessons learned on one 
project are applied to the next , 
endowing each building, each campu , 
with a unique personality. 

In 1963, the Regents of the 
University of California conceived and 
approved an "Academic Plan" for 
UCSD as part of an ambitiou 
expan ion plan. At this time Revelle 
College was already under 
construction, conceived a an addition 
to the decades-old' Scripp Institution 
of Oceanography. 

Completed in 1967, Revelle was a 
monument to an affluent era, 
sprawling across the hluffs as a free-
form exercise in architectural carte 
blanche. 

The same year, John Muir College 
was founded, the construction of 
which was undertaken in 1970 and '71. 
At that time, the UCSD. Long Range 
Development Plan calletl for- a total of 
12 separate campuses, designed to 
accomodate a total of 27,500 students. 

With this in mind, Muir was built 
under the stricture of land use, 
carefully integrated to pack maximum 
facilities into minimum space with a 
"tight," high-rise approach. The 
buildings were bestowed with a sharp-
edged, planar character, chosen to lend 
an "architectural identity" that would 
differentiate it from Revelle. 

Muir's buildings towered over 
Revelle 's more moderate structures. 
When the campus went into opera tion , 
man y' people felt that it was too "tight" 
to function as an effective learning 
environment. As a result , a different 
approach was taken in the conception 
of Third College, UCSD' most recent 
campus. 

In the face of a drooping budget, the 
12-college theme had been effectively 
scrapped. Space was no longer the 
major consideration, and there were no 
longer enough funds to send reinforced 
concrete screechin~ into the sky. In the 
years since Muir s com::~ption, the 
design parameters had flip-flop~, a 
result of first-hand experience and 
changing needs. 

Third College was the most heavily 
co t-analyzed of all the campuses. 
Built against a tightening budget, it 
represents the least expensive way to 
meet the needs -of the school. Low-
profile, wood and stucco buildings are 
clu tered around the cafeteria. It is 
more centralized than Revelle, but not 
nearly as "tight" as Muir. Each 
campu ' has been des igned and 
constructed by outside, private firms, 
but responsibility for the overall 
des ign and execution of on·campus 
construction fall s to the Office of 
Design and Construction under the 
direction of Charles Powers, who 
began his career at UCSD in 1963. 

Powers takes an aggressive pride in 
his staff of 14 licensed architects and 
engineers. He lays claim to producing 
more design and construction work per 
person than any other such group in 
the UC system.

Meet the press 
We're back. 
With this hefty 52-page orientation issue, we the 

staff of The UCSD Guardian resume our bi-weekly 
coverage of the university and immediate 
community. And since we hope you'll be turning to us 
as one source of news every Monday and Thursday, 
we'd like to tell you a bit about our operation . 

Unlike most other campus media (KSDT, new 
indicator, People's Voice, L'Chayim), the Guardian 
receives no direct university funding, a ide from :, 
sum from the chancellor's budget used to pay for the 
weekly calendar of events we publish . Instead, we 
subsist through the solicitation of advertising from 
both campus and community sources. At times, when 
businesses cut back on allocations for advertising, 
our economic health is threatened. In fact, inlanuary 
of 1981 the Guardian was forced to abandon a daily 
publication schedule because we couldn 't make ends 
meet. 

But we'd rather go to press twice a week as an 
independent newspaper than come out daily with the 
help of administration monies. Financial reliance on 
the university , we rea on, could encourage less 
aggressive coverage of the institution and related 
issues. 

In terms of staff, we are entirely tudent-run on the 
editorial side and employ three non-students who 
handle the advertising and admini trative ide of the 
paper, which has a circu lation of about 11,000. 

Mo t of the reporters , editors and photographers 
worked previous ly for their high school newspapers 
and find the Guardian affords practical experience 
not available throubh a journalism department here. 
The same is true of our production staff - all 
students as well - who handle everything from 
typesetting to paste up and gra phics work, with the 
sole exception of printing, which we have done in 
Encinitas. 

Aside from the standard news, opinion, arts and 
sports section ,the Guardian this year boa ts a new 
addition - a new feature section. On the pages of 
this weekly section we hope to run longer, more in-
depth and less structured stories. They may address 
abstract topics or merely approach standard news 
from a fresh perspective. 

Finally , the Guardian is your student newspaper, 
which means we want - and need - to hear from 
you. We hope, of course, that a score of you blooming 
David Halberstams will be pounding on our doors in 
no time, anxious to join our staff as reporters or at 
least regular contributors to the opinion page. You 
won't get rich writing for the Guardian, but you' ll 
make a few bucks and see your name in print. 

In any event, let u kn ow what you think of the 
paper and wha t you feel we're lacking. Better yet, let 
us know you ' re thinking by com menting on our 
editorials. You can write to u in care of the opinion 
editor, UCSD Guardia n, B-016, La 101la. 92093. or

from local banks to club listings and bu schedu les-

We hope this make your firs t few weeks a bit les~

Atkinson v. Perry: leave 
the case to judge and jury 

By PETER MORTENSEN 
The case of Perry v. 

Atkinson may not be one of 
lasting legal significance, if . 
indeed it ever makes it into ' 
court. Lee Perry's charge that 
the chancellor failed to father a 
child by her after once 
persuading her to abort a 
prevIous and s uccessful 
attempt at impregnation is a 
strange one, and difficult to 
prove. Even s tranger are her 
compensatory demands of the 
chance llo r for a ll eged l y 
breaking his ora l contract 
with her : $ 1 million in 
damage or agreement to 
impregnate her by artificial 
insemination . Yet while many 
marvel at the nature of Perry's 
allegations, the real issue and 
real damage remain unseen. 

A chancellor of a major 
univer sity is a public figure: 
vested in him is the ultimate 
responsibility for the direction 
a nd achievement of the 
university as it affects all 
those who come in contact 
with it. He i, of course, 
vulnerable to attacks on his 
profess ional conduct, a nd is 
accountable to the university 
community a a res ult. But 
unlike the less conspicuous 
per on - within or without 
the university - the 
chancellor's private life is 
s ubject to the exacti ng 
scruti ny of the institution he 
serves. Such frank inq uiry is 
essential to the life of the 
university, for its repu tat ion is 
in part dependent on the 
reputation of its leader. 

Viewed m thIS hght , it is 
understandable w hy the 
students , staff and faculty of 

UCSD should be concerned 
with the chancellor 's private 
conduct, particularly now 
when 1'erry's allegations 
question Atkinson 's s tandards 
of behavior and judgment -
standards we must assume he 
follow$ both privately and 
professionally. Jt is natural to 
ask whether a man who has 
been accused of encouraging 
another human being toward 
suicide is sufficiently rational 
and competent to continue as 
chief admini trator of a 
university. 

But we must a lso bear in 
mind that Richard Atkinson is 
innocent until proven guilty. 
To date, not one shred of 
evidence has been produced to 
substantiate Perry s claims. If 
the case goes before a judge 
and jury, then and only then 
will we possibly see any 
su bstantial evidence against 
our chancellor; then and only 
then will the circumstantial 
ev idence against him be 
I cCldered untainted by rumor 
and speculation . The jury will 
decide Richard Atkinson's 
guilt or innocence based solely 
on this presentation . No trial 
in t he press or at the 
university can render an 
unbiased and prudent verdict, 
and it is our responsibility to 
ensure that Atkinson is 
neither convicte d nor 
acquitted on any grou nd 
outside the courtroom. 

Ultimately, the coming 
weeks will test the balance 
between the private and public 
facets of the c hancellorsh ip. In 
question is whether the 
integrity of the institution and 
the individual ca n be 

maintained. There is no dOUbt 
that the reputation of each ha 
been at least temporari ly 
damaged - and neither is at 
fault. Only after a legal 
judgment has been made can a 
meaningful assessment of any 
loss of credibility be made. 
Only then hould this matter 
have an effect on the daily life 
of this university. 

*** 
This is the first in stallment 

of what I hope to be a weekly 
column, appearing Mondays in 
the UCSD Guardia1l. I hope to 
write about things that 
concern you, the reader, giving 
you my view of a s ituation and 
provoking you to agree or 
disagree with me. If I am going 
to work to write a weekly 
column , then [ expect you, 
when (a nd if) you read it, to at 
least think about it. And if 
you'd like to comment in any 
way on what I write, please 
write to the Letters department 
of thi page. It's the only way I 
know - and the Guardian 
knows - that you're alive out 
there. 

Next week I would like to 
tackle somet hing a little les 
weighty than the chancellor's 
predicament. If you have any 
ideas of what you 'd like to see 
me cover, just write them 
down and send them to me 
care of the Guardian. My 
notebook for ideas is always 
open.

Survival in a cyclists' world 
By KEITH GRANT-DAVIE 

If life at UCSD runs true to 
form, the perennial problem of 
bicycle on campus will crop 
up again this quarter. While 
we await a permanent solution 
to the problem, I thought I 
wou ld share with pedestrians 
a s urvival guide to the 
concrete corrida. 

Firs t, it' s important to 
unders tand that cycling is a 
form of mobile meditat ion . In 
the words of the gr at mas ter 
cyclist, Masi Miyata , "to cycle 
on a bu sy path is to be as a 
shuttle on the 100m of life. 
fl ying between th~ myriad 
thread s of humanit v." On the 
road 10 Zen ma.., ter\:. the pupil 

rider learns that self and ot her 
are not opposites but are one 
reality, and that to weave a 
path is to be part of the 
pattern. He learns to hold back 
and push forward, to weave 
left and weave right , to attune 
himself and hi s cycle to the ebb 
and flow of traffic , the y in and 
yang of bodies moving in 
opposite directions. He sees 
not people before him but 
s paces between peop le, 
opening and closing in a 
perpetual dance wi th an 
infinite number of s teps . 

Unfortunate ly, the neo· 
phyte's road to ma stery often 
lies a little too ncar to many 
ped estrians for their own 

peace of mind. Buffeted by the 
s lips tream of passing riders, 
their legs sometimes scuffed 
by black rubber or scarred by 
close encounters with flailing 
pedal , these pedestrians can 
be forgiven for cowling into 
the farawa y eyes of catatonic 
cyclists. 

Since the cyc1i ts draw 
inspiration from the teachers 
of the East. it would seem 
appropriate for those on foot to 
do the same. Few are aware 
that there already exists a 
school of self·defense ideal for 
their purposes . Askido. the art 
of self·defense aga inst cyclists. 
is as complex as any of the

An allegorical tale 

dietCoke: 
By SCOTT YOUNG 

A gentle breeze drifted over 
the bay from the west, 
encouraged by the warm rays 
of the evening sun . The breeze 
s wept over Fiesta Island. 
gathering in the ever· present 
odor of reclaimed sewage, from 
wh ich the island was created. 
Carrying the earthy reek like a 
mischievious elf , the evening 
zephyr dribbled into the 
private courtyard of the Hil ton 
Hotel on Mis ion Bay, swir ling 
around the magnifi cient 
geometric swi mming pool 
with the bridge, coating all the 
carefully prepar ed hors 
d 'oeuvres and flowing into the 
Grand Ballroom. Here the 
sweetish smell of marsh and 
fen came to rest, lining the 
meticulously groomed nose 
hairs of the Kings and Queens 
of San Diego Retail Sales. 

It was a gala extravaganza, 
true marble hall munificence

eral technical struggles, Ihe new 
jun ior politiciam of UCSD were 
officially im ta ted. For the aver·

The Commissioners 

The commissioners work 
wit hin a committee to accomp-
lish specific tasks that meet 
the need and concerns of the 
UCSD students. 
Academic Affairs 

Lee Anderson , the commis-
sioner of Academic Affairs, is 
responsible for insuring stu-
dent input on academic issues 
at UCSD. Issues that concern 
libraries, professors, teaching 
assistants (TA's) and all aca-

Community Sevice Officers 
escort thousands in first year 

By BETH MOORE 
Community Service Offi-

cers are a group of 20 students 
under the direction of Sgt. 
Clark Martin of the UCSD 
Police Department. Their 
primary responsibility is the 
safety and protection of the 
campus community. Since the 
beginning of the program on 
July 10, 1981, they have proven 
to be an important addition to 
the UCSD police force. 

Alth ough the major 
contribution of the CSOs i the 
establi hment of an escort 
service, they perform other 
duties as well. The e include 
securing ca mpus buildings at 
night, the testing of 
emergency call boxes each 
week, animal control. parking 
citations and the reporting of 
assaults and other criminal 
acti vity through use of the two 
way radios that each officer 
carries. 

Each CSO has completed 
between eight and 16 hours of 
training. During this training 
period they are instructed in 

the use of the two way radios 
and in what they are permitted 
to do in their job capacity. FQr 
example, the CSOs are not 
allowed to interfere in an 

Bicycle 
Registration 

Once again the UCSD Police 
Department will be on hand to 
register bicycles during 
Welcome Week. Engraving 
pencils will also be available 
for those students wishing to 
mark their driver's license 
number on personal property. 
All student s are encouraged to 
partici pate in this activity 
which help guard against 
theft - the biggest area of 
crime on campus. 

Operation Iden ti fica ~ion , 
the name of the program, will 
be located on each of the four 
college campu es as well as the 
Mesa Apartments. 

assault. They are in stead to 
radio the police station . 
Campus security is another 
big area on the CSO training 
list. 

Their training has payed off, 
according to campus Police 
Chief Hugh French , who 
reports that the CSOs have 
had a successful first year. 
They have been instrumental 
in I he recovery of slolen 
property and in the identifica· 
tion and apprehension of 
suspects. 

They have also escorted an 
average of 400 students a 
month. This may be one 
reason for the decrease in 
attempted rape over the last 
year. More importantly, "The 
Community Service Offiers 
function as the eyes and ears of 
the Police Department," says 
French. 

The CSOs are on duty daily 
from 5 p.m . to 1 a.m. They may 
be contacted by telephoning 
452-HELP and are recogniza· 
ble by their bright yellow T-
shirts and windbreakers.

- The AS Council working 
well as a team so that these 
goals may be accomplished. 

Many of these ideas came as 
a result of visits Chu made 
during the summer to other 
UC campuses. 

For example, UCSD is the 
only UC school which does not 
pay . student government 
~ffJclals a stipend. "A stipend 
IS necessary (or an officer to be 
efficient," said Chu. The 
question of whether or not to 
have stipends will probably 
appear on a referendum that 
Chu would like to put to a vote 
some time this quarter. 

This is Chu' s second year on 
the AS Council. Last year he 
was commissioner of academic 
affairs .

Pregnancy and promises 
UCSD Chancellor sued over sperm 

By SCOTT YOUNG 

UCSD Chancellor Richard 
C. Atkinson is currently 
involved in a bizarre lawsuit 
alledging, among other things, 
that he reneged on a promise to 
impregnate a Harvard 
University professor after she 
aborted their first child at his 
request. 

Dr. Lee Perry, associate 
professor of education at 
Harvard 's Graduate School of 
Education, and her attorney 
Marvin Mitchelson, filed s uit 
again s t Atkinson during 
February 1981 in Los Angeles. 

The lawsuit, in which Perry 
i seeking over $1 million in 
damages, alledges that Perry 
became pregnant by Atkinson 
during the course of an affair 
they were having in 1977. 
Atkin on. according to Perry's 
charges in the suit , asked her 
to have an abortion because 
the pregnancy "would be 
destructive to him at that 
particular time." Atkin on. 
now 53. was director of the 
Nationa l Science Foundation 
in ]977. 

Perry claims, in the text of 
the lawsuit, that she had the 
abort ion upon receIvIng 
Atkinson 's promise that he 
would impregnate her, either 
naturally or artificially, the 
fo llowing yea r. 

lawyer has had transferred to 
San Diego courts. " The 
allegations are false and are so 
far-fetched that it is hard to 
believe they can be the basis of 
a laws uit, " he said . 

Looking pale around the 
edges of his perennial good tan, 
Atkinson read his official 
pre ss state m e nt in a 
monotone, stressing only the 
statement s, " I am not the 
person responsible for Dr. 
Perry's pregnancy. Further-
more , at no time did I try to 
persuade her to have an 
abortion." 

The chancellor, acting on 
the advice of his lawyer, would 
not answer reporters' 
que tions. 

law uit tha t Atkinson told 
Perry "that if her being 
deprived of her right to have a 
child with him would cause 
her mental distress, she ought 
to commit suicide." 

A new twist was recently 
added to the suit when Perry 
prom ise d , through her 
attorney, to drop the suit 
entirely if Atkin son would 
artificially inseminate her . 

Although the Guardian wa 
unable to obtain an interview 
with Mitchelson , a story in 
la t Thur day's Sail Diego 
Unjon quoted the attorney as 
aying. "The money is not 

near as important to her as the 
child . She'd gladly trade one 
for the other." 

Perry, a clinical psycholo· 
gist and associate director of i 
the coun eling and consulting 

Mitchelson , famous for his 

p yc hol ogy program at 
Harvard, has filed requests for 
extensive financial records 
from Atkinson, includi ng 
check tubs, hotel reservation 
receipt and airli ne ticket 
stubs. These records allegedly 
document the existence of her 
affair with the chancellor, as 
well a the abort ion . 

representation of Michelle 
Marvin in her landmark 
palimony case against actor 
Lee Marvin, said in the same 
interview that he took the case 
"because I am commItted to 
women's civil rights, and one 
of the rights they have is to 
have a child. 

"We feel we've 
been dealt a 
savage blow" 

Atkinson expressed bitter-
nes about the case, saying, .. [t 
is simply the case thal anyone 
can file a lawsuit for $75 and 
make any remarks they want, 

.13 

and it becomes very difficult 
during the course of a legal 
action to provide any type of 
public respon e to those 
accusations. 

"We fee . grievously 
wronged. We feel we've been 
dealt a savage blow," Atkinson 
said, speaking for his family 
and particularly for his wife. 
Rita, who stood by his side 
throughout the pre ss 
conference. 

"Rita and [ have been 
married for 30 years. We 
celebrated our. 30th anniversa-
ry in August. Her love and 
loyalty and support have been 
a remarkable source of 
strength for me ... during this 
difficult period. 

'The next two weeks are 
going to be tough. But [ am not 
going to be driven out of my 
posit ion as chancel10r of the 
university by a set of charges 
that are absolutelv false ." 

A source at Harvard. who 
a. ked to remain anonymou<;. 
rold the Guardian that Perry 
was "acti\e 10 educational 
psychology ... She' supposed to 
be a normal teacher. though 
not well-known ... She's sort of 
a non-entity around here." 

The ource also reported 
that on her first day of c1as , 
Perry made no allusions to the 
suit but ran out of class early 
to avoid quest ions. 

Calling a press conference 
last week at the multi-million 
dollar cliffside home which 
accompanies his chancellor-
ship, Atkinson denied all of the 
charges in the suit, which his 

Her suit, which Atkinson 
call the "culmination of five 
years of harassment and 
threats," alledges further t hat 
Atkinson told Perry in early 
1980 that if sh e continued to 
threa ten him with a lawsui the 
would "ruin her reputation, 
destroy her career and deprive 
her of her righ t to earn a 
livelihood." 

UCSD Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson with his wife Rita 
looking grim during the press conference at their home. 

Perry graduated with 
honors in hi tory and 
literature from Radcliffe 
College in 1964. he received 
her master 's degree in 
education in one year and 
finished her PhD in education 
in 1970 at Harvard. She 
received her current position 
at Harvard in 1977, the same 
year she alledgedly became 
pregnant by Atkinson. It is also claimed in the

'People were linked

It's t he UC-managed 
Lawrence Livermore Labora-
tory, and many of those who 
labor within its walls design 
the tate-of-the-art nuclear 
devi ces our leaders may 
someday choose to lob at a 
given enemy. 

Many of the lab personnel 
mak e their home s in 
Livermore; lots of them ride 
their bicycles daily along the 
town's level residential streets 
to the monstrous weapons 
facility . One morning lastJune 
these commuters found an 
ob tacle in their path as they 
sought access to the lab 
grounds. People -lots of them 
- were linked arm in arm 
across every road approaching 
the complex . The e people, 
LAG mem bers and some 5,000 
supporters, intended that day 
to keep lab workers from doing 
their job. 

••• 
As early as 4 a .m. on June 21 

cars . loaded with anti ·nuclear 
activists were streaming off of 
Interstate 580 through the 
heart of Livermore toward the 
research facility which, along 
with the Los Alamos 
Laboratory, has designed 
virtually all of the United 
States' nuclear weapons. An 
early arrival was necessary, 
LAG organizers reasoned, in 

units from several surroun-
ding communities. 

Most wore hel mets, plastic 
visors down. Most carried 
clubs. Many carried guns. 
Some struggled to restrain 
German Shepards. Some lined 
the road in patrol cars. Some 
stood in s ide the lab 's fences, 
watching the blockaders 
assemble . Most looked very 
seriou about their job. 

After all, with the exception 
of the massive early June 
march in New York City, this 
day at Li vermore promised to 
be the largest anti -nuclear 
gathering ever held on this 
side of the Atlantic. Law 
enforcement officers were 
bound to be OHt in force. 

'They knew things 
could get rough ... 
and dangerous.' 

The demons trators wer e 
s imilarl y well prepared . 
Alth ough LAG had been 
staging blockade , marches, 
rallies and other forms of 
protest against the lab's work 
in nuclear weapons research 
since its formal birth in 
Berkeley last year, 1982 was 
clearly the big year, with June 
21 the apex of W est Coa t

continued from page 17 
Americans were ready to take 
a hard look at the nuclear 
war/weapons issue. 

By the scores people of all 
ages, colors. income levels and 
political persuasions were 
joining community and 
national groups organized to 
involve the public in the 
nuclear debate. And the most 
involved would likely show up 
at Livermore, anxious to make 
a statement about a situation 
that was making them 
increasingly nervous. 

The blockaders, members of 
LAG affinity groups from as 
far away as San Diego, knew 
what lay ahead. They knew 
they would be arrested for 
trespassing. handcuffed and 
taken for a three day stay to 
the Santa Rita Rehabilitation 
Center. They knew things 
could get uncomfortable, 
rough. dangerous. Many of 
them knew because they'd 
been there before. Others were 
prepared by the day·long "non-
violent training sessions" 
LAG requires of all blockaders. 
In these workshops. the 
demonstrators discuss the 
history of civil disobedience, 
practice tactics of passive 
resistance and learn how to 
work in groups to formulate 
effective strategies. 

The game plan. LAG 
spokesman Ken Nightingale 
says, was simply to interrupt 
business as usual at the lab for 
the day, to at least slow' 
progress on the development of 
the MX missile and the 
neutron bomb, two devices for 
which Livermore has the sole 
contracts. In addition, LAG 
hoped for - and got -
extensive media coverage of 
the blockade to focus attention 
on the group's goals. 

Success? Yes, LAG members 
say. By noon, only half of the 
lab's workers had made it to 
work , with others being 
turned back by the blockade o~ 
remaining home to avoid 
confrontation altogether. At 
the end of the day, nearly 1400 
blockaders had been arrested, 
a high total attractive to the 
press. There were few violent 
incidents, no serious injuries. 
And the protest made 
headlines in all local papers 
and on all local and network 
news programs. 

One expected setback came 
two days later when the 
charges against the arrested 
blockaders were reduced from 
misdemeanor to infraction -
jay walking -, thus derailing 
LAG's intent ion to take the 
matter to the courts. Most of 
those arrested were released 
on time erved. 

LAG members say they -
learned a lot from the blockade 
and gained experience they are 
employing now as they 
prepare for their next big 
protest on Oct. 9. The 9th 
marks the 30th anniversary of 
the lab , and Li vermore 
officials are planning a gala 
fete. They have a lot to 
celebrate. While most resea rch 
and development facilities 
across the country are 
dismantling programs due to 
budget cuts, Livermore next 
year will enjoy a 30 percent 
increase in weapons program 
staff' plus a 12.6 percent 
increase in the share of the 
budget the lab allocates to 
wea,pons work . Meanwhile, 
energy programs at the lab are 
being curtailed and its solar 
program was recently 
eliminated. 

LAG members plan 10 stage 
a count r-demunstration at 
t he anniversary ex t ravaganza.

Debauchery in ' the Great'Northwest 
By Thomas Rankin 

New. Editor 

Hard charging out of Walnut 
Creek at 3 a.m., eyes propped 
open with a fistfull of cross tops 
and a large Winchells' coffee. 
My mouth tastes like raw 
sewage and I'm vigorously 
clawing at my throat and neck. 
On the back seat lies an aged 12-
guage breakaway side-by-side 
shotgun, four cases of Bud la/Is 
and a carton ofStimula 'Rough 
Rider' condoms. 

Oh Christ, it's summer 
vacation. 

Ketchum. Idaho, is the 
service village to the world 
famous Sun Valley ski resort, 
a curious mix of backwater 
depression and big-money 
glitter. Although no signs 
make the proclimation, its 
only other claim to fame is the 
fact that it i s where 
Hemingway chose to do 
himself in. 

before the field of nuclear 
power had become an industry, 
those in charge had used their 
heads. 

After Doug ventilated the 
small , commemorative plaque 
on the roadside, we drove a 
half·mile down a dirt road to 
the plant itself. 

For all its historical 
significance, the place wasn't 
much to look at. just a small 
white shed surrounded by 
GAO Galaxy 500s and a few 
suspicious-looking barrels 
marked "DANGER." Doug 
and I tossed a few rocks over 
the fence and da hed a fre hly-
emptied Jack Daniel s bottle 
against the locked gate, hoping 
to get a rise out of the androids 
inside. 

Out of desperatlOn. I began 
bleepmg the Fiat 's tmy horn . 
but to no a vail. We placated 
ourselves by listening to Tom 
Petty , sweatin g in t he 
awesome, radioactive Idaho 

ilence. 
But I digress. 

In the summer. when profits 
and losses sneak back to blind 
trusts in Salt Lake and 
Indonesia, Ketchum becomes 
something of a Sausilito 
North, safe refuge for mindless 
herds of anti· meat, more-
holistic· than-thou Vuarnet 
groupies. Tired Volvos line the 
rutted streets, their occupants 
browsing in boutiques with 
names like "The Chicdom" 
and "Bruce and Billy's." 

I spent two long, hot August 
days in Ketchum, foraging for 
food from a green Eureka 
Timberline tent about five 
miles west of the town proper. 
My traveling companion.was 

an old friend named Doug. a 
carpenter with an unnatural 
Ius t for guns and, oddly 
enou~h, unsalted butter. 
Doug s favorite car game was 
peppering road signs with 
double-ought buckshot at 85 
miles per hour. 

We had fled Idaho' s 
Sawtooth Mountain National 
Park on a Wedne sday, 

planning a short piss-and-a-
postcard stop in Ketchum 
before undertaking an 
amphetamine marathon back 
to California. This wa the last 
leg of a long serie of bru tal ice-
axe assaults on Wyoming's 
Grand Tetons. Our stay t here, 
at a private camp in Jackson 
Hole, had been hectic. In a 
single da y. my life was saved 

by a vanload of New York 
hippis and my camera stolen 
by a computer salesman from 
St. Louis. 

On the run from the 
Sawtooths to Ketchum, we 
had stumbled acro s, of all 
things, the World's First 
Nuclear Reactor, smack in the 
middle of Idaho and , so it 
follows, nowhere. Apparently, 

Ketchum is actually a very 
nice little town. Nice, that i ,if 
you lean towards snake kin 
boots, leather jockey shorts 
and 13-year-old pinheads with 
white powder mustaches . For 
humans, thegreate t benefit is 
the close proximity of 
excellent shooting and 
backpacking areas. The quiet 
of the mountains i broken 
only by the prattle of two-
stroke motorcycle engines and 
the hideous wails of the aged 
Mormons who trek into the 
hills to die.

Some Basic Facts Every UCSD Student Should Know 
About Medical Care and Insurance 

------A Message From Your Student Health Service------
In the United States, the cost of medical ca re is considered to be a personal 

expense, just Uke the costs of food , clothing. and shelter, for all persons not eligible 
for welfare. You are therefore responsible for the costs of any medical care you 
receive away from the Student Health Service. (The cost of the care you receive 
from the Student Health Service staff is prepaid rrom Registration Fee funds and 
does not cost you anything extra) . 

Medical care away frem the Student Health Center is expensive. Sickness and 
accident insurance plans were invented to help everyone meet much of the cost of 
medical care. When you pay a premium, a carrier guarantees to pay a cert";n 
amount toward the cost of specified medical expenses you may incur over a 
specified period of time. All insurance plans are very specific about the 
circumstances under which an insured person will be eligible to receive benefits. 
No plan can cover .U the expenses a person might incur for every conceivable 
health problem he or she.may have. Insurance plans are therefore designed to 
reduce out·of·pocket expenses when you become sick or are injured, and offer 
you the peace of mind that your expenses for any particular coverable sickness or 
injul1l will be paid fo r at least partially. 

Beginning with the fall quarter of 1982, bills for medical care will not be paid for 
you by the campus. But as an additional benefit of the Registration Fee you pay 
during the fall, winter, and spring quarters, you will be automatically covered 
under a STUDENT UMITED INSURANCE PLAN. The PLAN has been 
endorsed by the Student Health Service Advisory Committee and the premium 
for it is paid for you by UCSD. It is desi!Jled to provide you with some insurance 
benefits toward the costs of some of the care you may need away from the Student 
Health Center. Remember that the PLAN is limited. It can not cover all the 
eKpenses you may have. Benefits are provided for some physicians' fees, 
ambulance charges, and the costs of other specific outpatient services as 
explained in the insurance brochure. It does not cover outpatient expenses 
beyond the specified doOar limits and does not provide any benefits for 
h05pitalizafion. You are therefore urged to buy additional insurance protection, 
such as the VOLUNTARY INSURANCE PLAN, which supplements the 
STUDENT UMITED INSURANCE PLAN by providing additional benefits for 
outpatient care, as well as benefits for hospitalization. Even this plan, however, can 
not cover cempleteiy every possible expense; no plan can. You may pay for this 
VOlUNTARY INSURANCE PlAN by including the premium with the fees you 
pay when you register each quarter. You may also enroll by contacting the 
insurance representative at the Student Health Center cilring the first few ~ of 
each quarter. 

Yau should be lNIMe that you cannot buy nsurance ...... you discover that 
you have a health ploblem and expect tlmt the inllluance will cover that condition. 
It won't. Insurance must be in effect Wore a sickness or injury occurs_ AI&o, if 
you aIow any optional insurance to \apse coverage wiD be interrupted, and even if 
you renew your couerage later, benefits may not be paid for any conditions you 
had before the interruption in coyerage. 

Whenever you receive medical care away from the Student Health Center , you 
will be billed by the provider of the service you receive. The responsibility fo r the 
payment of such bills is yours. To receive any benefits from °he insurance plans 
described in the insurance brochure you must personally file a cla im With the 
company, following the simple procedure explained In the brochure The 
insurance carrier will review your claim and will pay whatever portion of your bills 
is coverable under the conditions of the applicable Insurance plan. 

If you are not eligible for benefits, or if there are expenses left over after 
applicable benefits have been paid, the responsiblity for the payment of these 
expenses is still yours. That is the way all insurance plans work. Please remember 
that UCSD and the Student HealthService are not res[lonsible for the expenses of 
any outside medical care you may receive, regardless of whether or not you were 
referred for the care by the Student Health Service stalf. An insurance 
representative is available at the Student Health Center to answer any questions 
you might have about the insurance. For further inforlT'allon, brochures, and 
applications, drop by or call 452·3300. 

If you are covered under an insurance plan throug, your parents or spouse, you 
should consider retaining that insurance if at all possible. Insurance t hat is already 
in effect may cover you for conditions you may already have. The insurance 
available from the campus generally can only cover you for sickness or Injury 
occurring after you become covered. That would be September 14, 1982 or the 
day after the Insurance agent receives the insurance form and premium, 
whichever is later. 

During the 1982-83 school year, currently registered students who pay full 
regis tration fees may receive unlimited services without charge from the doctors 
and nurses who staff the Student Health Center on campus. The Center is open 
from 8:00 to 11:30 a .m. and 1:00 to 4:30 p.m. Monday thru Friday and provides 
general medical care and minor surgery for all problems. It is closed on weekends 
and holidays. Basic laboratOI1l tests , x-rays, and physical therapy ordered by the 
professional staff are provided from existing fadlities without charge or limit. A 
number of special programs are also offered at no C05t, indudilll sports mediCine 
clinic, contraceptive counseling and ecilcation clinic, and dennalology clinic. 

The UCSD Student Health Service, which operates the Student Health Centff, 
also makes available Jow.c05t plmmacy prescri>tion, a1ler!ll dellsensittzatlo'l,

Mal1~Y bats and guns 
continued from paale 19 

In the ever.ing of our first 
day, as tt'e sun quite 
intelligently crawled towards 
the Pacific, Doug emptied both 
barrels of the shotgun into a 
SQuirrel. We roasted what was 
left of t he corpse over an open 
fire and dined on about a half-
ounce of slimy brown gristle. 
The second course was a box of 
Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, and 
we balanced out the meal with 
a litre of Canadian Club. 

The night was blessed with 
a full moon. Around nine 
o'clock, vague shadows began 
flitting about on the ground 
and we looked up, confronting 
a sky filled with peeping. 
fluttering little bats. Doug 
pulled the shells out of his 
pack and thus be~at the 
infamous "Bat Safari. ' 

The targets, their sonar 
baffled by the thunder of our 
"antibatcraft artillery, " were 
piteously silhoueted against 
the starry sky. By cocking 
both barrel at once. each pull 
of the tri~er scattered high-

velocity buckshot skyward in 
a pattern about four feet 
across. Even the most casual 
aim would bring down a tiny 
mass of mangled Antichrist 
BA T flesh , blood and bones 
glistening horribly in the 
ethereal, blue light. 

The ammo ran out about the 
same time as the whiskey (too 
soon), so we bedded down. 

'The sky filled with 
peeping, fluttering 
little ~ts ... ' 

hoping to get an early start on 
the next day. We didn't 

The sun was well into the 
sky by the time we regained 
consciousness the following 
morning, and the birds were 
tweeting so fucking happily in 
their fucking trees here in 
lovely, fucking Idaho. For 
breakfast. we scraped the last 
of the macaroni from its pot 

The UCSD ~uardian 

and brewed up some lumpy 
Swiss Miss , coughing, 
smoking and convulsing in the 
fresh, dewey grass. 

The meadow around us 
looked like a scene from an 
Andy Warhol wet dream . 
Disgusting little ' bat bodies 
were scattered everywhere, 
tastefully mixed in with 
cigarette butts and expended 
shell casings. My credo with 
respect to the wilderness is to 
always leave an area better 
than I find it. This was a 
definite improvement. 

We packed our belongings 
and began our painful return 
to civilization, not even 
bothering to remove our boots 
when we tramped through the 
various creeks that crossed 
our path. As we loaded up the 
car, I noted a lightness against 
my right buttock, discovering 
to my horror that my wallet 
was missing. Panic ensued, 
soon turnil1g to outrage and 
finally to hair ·p ulling 
hysteria . 

The wallet, which contai ned 
all our cash and travelers 
checks, was nowhere to . be 
found. All Doug had was his 
Chevron card, which would 

Get in on the fast track. 

Nobody steps right out of college into the executive suite 
in business. But in the Army, you could step right into 
executive responsibility. 

We regularly place people under the age of 25 into respon-
sible management positions. We call them officers . 

And we call our management training program Officer 
Candidate School. It 's fourtee n inten e weeks of learning the 
science of manage ment and the art of leadership. Along with 
th( responsibilities of bei ng an Army officer, come the 
privileges. Like the chance to take g raduate courses. with the

If you' re looking for a rnanagemenr position in a big

feed the Fiat, but was of little 
use to the sensibilities of two 
hungry Americans. 

Between us, Doug and I had 
87 cents in change and a half 
pack of Marlboros, so we 

'decided to run to town for 
coffee and a summit meeting, 
hoping to figure out how to 
deal with the situation. 

I barreled down the rough 
dirt road, yanking at the 
hand brake in corners to put 
the car into a white-knuckle. 
reverse·steering·lock slide. On 
·the paved straight that .passed 

'The ammo ran out 
about the same time 
as the whiskey ... ' 

by the foot of Mount Bald y, I 
brought the engine to a 
screaming redline in top gear. 
AIl-out, balls-to-t he -wall 
motoring in a Fiat 128 only 
yields about 85 or 90 miles an 
hour , but the visceral 
sensat ion is equal to that of a 
429 at a hundred and a half. 

The car, in fact, was 
without doubt one of the 

highlights of the trip. With all 
our gear in the trunk , the 
heartbreaking front ·drive 
understeer was effectively 
neutralized, and skilled use of 
the parking brake at speed 
would bring the rear end about 
faster than I could say 
/eltucini. 

It was as consistent and 
dependable as the Italian 
government, breaking down in 
the middle of nowhere at all 
the wrong times. Earlier in the 
trip the clutch cable had let go 
in a farm town in southern 
Idaho. We replaced it with a 
choke wire from a Freeman 
hay baler, using only a flat · 
head screwdriver and a pair of 
vice grips. "Meterc wrentch? 
Wut in Hayal 's a meterc 
wrentch?" 

A few of the photos from the 
trip feature the Fiat, a tiny 
yellow cube cowering amidst 
the menacing peaks of the 
Northwest, far , far away from 
the crying streets of Milan. I 
developed the same sort of 
perverted affection for it as I 
might for a drooling, senile 
dog, a mixture of pity , 
frustration and awe.

Europe is real pretty and full of strange people 
By MICHAEL AHN 

There are some items that 
should be printed in the 1983 
edition of Let's Go Europe, 
t hings that might seem 
obvious to all but the naive 
American, such as: 

1. No ska dancing on the 
s teps of the Parthenon. 

2. No spitt ing wads of 
chewed up crepes off the Eiffel 
Tower. 

3. Don't fly Bermuda shorts 
from the flagpole on t he hotel 
room balcony. 

4. Etc., etc., etc. 
Actually, the statue and 

cities I saw on my three week 
trip to Europe were not half as 
breathtaki ng as the people I 
met there; genuinely solid 
s inner,s saints, and generally 
mutated human being. 

Here is a list of a few of the 
standouts : 

Th e Three AustraJiall 
Women on the Train (Italy)-
Nice people from Perth: a 
speech therapist, an ex-na nny, 
and a woman who worked in a 
copper min e in the Outback . 
All were in their mid·twenties, 
and they were terribly 
insulted when I said that the 
only Australians I knew of 
were Olivia Newton-lohn , Men 
At Work, and Mad Max. They 
thought I was crazy for li ving 
on the San Andreas fault 
("Don 't you realize you're 
goi ng to s lide into the ocean 
someday? Good gawd!"), so 1 
told them that NA A 
purpo ely made Skylab crash 
on their cont inent , and we 
were actually aimi ng for 
Sidney. They liked Americans. 
and did a particularly good 

EXCLU51VE 

imitation of typical American 
tourists, clipping the vowels 
and hardening the consonant 
like, "C'mere, Madge, hava 
likit Ihis!" I guess you had to be 
there. They also told me that 
to "chunder" is Australian 
lang for throwing up, which 

ca me abo ut from when 
Australian in bunkbeds 
would warn their mate below 
by blurting "Watchunder ya!" 
before they did their big -,pit. 

The New Zealanders if! Ihe 

Volkswagen Vans Decora ted 
with the Obscene Graf/iti (Italy) 
- They were al l male, all over 
six feet tall, a ll in shorts a nd no 
hirts, all tattooed, all bald or 

wearing Mowhawks, and all 
very drunk. They had a total 
disregard for human dignity 
and were not to be trusted, but 
were great to watch blasting 
through the crowded Italian 
avenue, s plitting the locals 
like the Red Sea, singing a song 
about being "six feet four and 
full of thunder.· · They rod e on 
the same ferry to Greece that I 
did and they spent most of the 
two day voyage lying prone on 

th e sundeck , s leeping off 
whatever damage they had 
don e to themselves in Porl. 
They could not complete one 
s impl e s entence without 
interjecting an obscenity . 
Overall, a great bunch of guy. 
They also had a habit of going 
for any female t hat showed 
sign s of life, without much 
success. They were si mply too 
monsterous to be believed. 

The Canadian Girl un Ihe 
Boat (lravel/ill/( on the ferry 

from l/a/y to Greece) - She 
wa eventeen but looked 
about twelve, and she was 
travelling through Europe 
alone for two months without 
any working knowledge of any 
language excepl Engli sh. 
gutsy to ay the lea t. She had 
an accent like Bob and Doug 
MacKenzie. She was oneofthc 
brave but few that moved on 
s heer nerve, striki ng up 
conversat ions with anyone 
who cou ld understand, 
including hostile people like 
me. It alians lo\'ed her because 
bhe resrmbled.a lifelike kwepie 
doll with a chai nsmoking 

habi t. She was the only person 
I ever met t hat could get 
seriously tipsy on one can of 
beer . 

Th e /la/ifQJ. Guy (on the same 
boa!) - He ~ nineteen years 
old. ca rried a razor·sharp 
st iletto blade on hi hip, had a 
mass of hair that cascaded in 
greasy lumps down to the 
middle of his back, and moved 
with the dash and charisma of 
Errol Flynn. This was his last 
summer fl ing before joining 

the Italian army to become a 
military policeman, and he and 
his buddy were roaming the 
continent making as many 
friends as possible. He shared 
all of his possessions and mad e 
everybody el e share what 
food they had until we had a 
continual feast going of 
tomatos . bread, jam and 
st range delicious delicac ie ~ 
that were quickly consumed 
and never identified. He had 
the ability to make anyone 
smile. He had an out ward 
appearance uf being \cry 
dangerous. but he turned out 
to be • trang and straigh t, 

avoiding any mind·bending 
experiences except those that 
came naturally. 

The Bartender Ihat Hesem· 
bledJoll1l Beillshi (in the baron 
the boa/) - He was the first 
Greek who said, "No Coke. 
Pepsi." 

Svhtia, the ftalian (0 /1 the 
SUI/deck o/Ihe boal) - GlolI. ing 
r e d hair and limpid, 
mediterranean blue eyes. he 
had a pre ence that could be 
sensed like 070ne snapping 
through dry air. She \\as an 
expert at meltmg boys \\Ith 
cold, even glances. he left me 
and the Italtan guy in puddles 
on the rolling deck. When she 
spoke she was extremely polite 
and formal to everyone at all 
times. 

The Drunk Greek Alall a/ the 
Disco (Hydra) - He was thirt v-
three years old and spent all 
his time at the Disco u ing the 
most obscene and twisted 
pickup lin es on rigid, 
middleaged German women. 
They would walk away from 
him with an expression on 
their faces a if a two hundred 
and twenty pound slug had 
slithered up to them and asked 
them to do the pogo. He al 0 
had the best beer belly of all 
time, anywhere. 

Johll Ihe Greek (Hydra) - A 
friend of the American tourist 
who went to school In 
Michigan but \\a~ born and 
raised in Greece . fie tned to 
gl\"e the impression of beIng an 
incredible \\'lZard at picking up 
women of different national!-

24 The UCSD Guardian 

N'eat people in Europe 
continued from pale 21 
each country (flatter 
American women, ignore 
Greek women, 8et British 
women drunk, etc.). I never got 
the privilege of seeing him in 
action because he spent most 
of his time drinking himself 
into a paraplegic stupor. 

The One Hundred and 
Ninety Eight Year Old Greek 
Innkeeper (Hydra) - She 
looked like Charles Bronson. 
From the moment she found 
out were were American 
tourists she kept us under 
total surveillance, sitting all 
'day at the end of the hall with 
an expression locked on her 
face daring us to try 
something. Naturally we felt 
obligated to live up to her 
hideous expectations so we 
danced to loud, degenerate be-
bop music on the balcony and 
yelled "The Dodgers suck" to 
any passers-by that would 
lend their ears. She gave us the 
room next to the town clock 
tower that gonged out the time 
every hour, day or night. It 
wa like trying to s leep 
through an airstrike. Her 
moment of joy wa informing 
us that there was no hot water, 
and that bathing in ice water 
would be a "refre hing change 
from the hot un ." Hearing 
this, we flew our Bermuda 
shorts at half-mast from the 
balcony flagpole. 

The German Girl (Hydra) -
he showed UP at the nude 

20% 

sunbathing beach with hickey 
marks on her body that were 
not to be believed. Kodak 
confiscated my pictures of her.. 

The Ferrel (on Ihe Irain back 
to Paris) - He had the exact 
skull and facial characteristics 
of a common ferret. I never got 
up enough nerve to sneak a 
picture of his profile. 

The African in the Bar 
(France) - A man who bore a . 
striking resemblence to 
Moamar Khadaffi . When I 
walked into the dungeonlike 
atmosphere of the place he 
stormed out from a dark 
corner, wrapped a huge arm 
around my shoulder, jammed 
his massive face in about two 
inc hes from mine , and 
bellowed in broken English, 
"You not from here! Where are 
you coming from?" I said that I 
came from America and he 
pounded his chest and said, "I 
am from AFRIKA!" I said 
that's fine but I'm going to 
play pinball now and could he 
please relea e my houlder 
from his Libyan deathgrip. He 
winked, pinched my cheek, 
and let go. I hauled as . 

The Obnoxious French 
Waiter (Paris) - He fit the 
stereotype perfectly. He was 
grossly Insulted when I 
ordered my steak well done 
and nearly threw a fit when I 
didn't finish my onion soup. [ 
feared for my life when I 
ordered Coke instead of wine. 
With claRsic French sarca m 

OFF RETAIL ON MOST ART SUPPLIES 

he asked if "Monsieur would 
like catsup for his meat?" 

The Virginian (Ihe plane 
back) - My first meeting with 
a normal American in three 
long weeks. She bit me when I 
was trying to sleep. 

The people there are about 
as average as the people here. I 
hesitate to think of what 
might iJdppen to the poor 
European fool who stumbles 
into this twisted fantasyland 
of bad craziness West of the 
Rockies. And to be really 
obtusely and unreasonably 
profound, there is something 
to be learned from all people, 
like how to use a bidet 
properly. Kermit said it best 
when he croaked. "It's not that 
easy being green. "

Pedestrian's guide 
to self defense here 
continued from page 2 
popular Oriental martial arts. 
Legend has it that it was 
developed in the 13the 
Century, when the monks of 
the Lao-shwin mona.s tery 
were sufferin~ at the wheels of 
Miyata 's firs t wobbling 
follwers, in the days when the 
spiritual potential of the 
bicycle was just being 
discovered. The Lao-shwin 
monks meditated on the 
problem for many days and the 
solution finally came in the 
shape of a Spanish matador 
(traveling with Marco Polo at 
the time), who fought a 
Chinese water buffalo outside 
the gates of the monastery . 
The monks observed with 
interest, seeing possi bilities. 
As the buffalo sank to its 
knees, a number of them 
approached the matador 
shyly, asked for lessons, and 
Miyata's crowd was seen 
leaving t he area s hortly 
afterwa rds, on foot. 

Since those early days, the 
masters have perfected a 
system of kicks , blocks. 
punches and feints that looks a 
little like unarmed bullfight-
ing and renders them virtually 
immune to any two-wheeled 
as au It. However, the novice 
can enjoy a new confidence 
and greater security by 
learning just a handful ofba ic 
techniques. 

First, there are the three 
primary stances: the Grass-

hopper (cicada·tach,), the Frog 
(ribilsa-Iachl) and the Cat 
(miaoIurri·purri). These 
allow swift evasive action in 
any direction and provide a 
stable foundation for counter-
attacks. 

Counterattacks take the 
form of kicks, punches and 
throws. Of the latter, the three 
most common are shwin·tossi 
for head'(ln attacks, ippon· 
moto·bekan for angled attacks 
and hu//i-ogashi for attacks 
from behind. The object of 
these throws is to put rider 
and bike on the ground, a 
condition known as tenspj 
waipowli. 

Pedestrians, or askidoka, are 
not always able to take hold of 
a fast-moving cycle firmly 
enought to execute a throw. If 
this is t he case, the simplest 
alternative methods of scoring 
a tellspi waipowli are pujo·pushi 
(a body block), oi·tsukijujiryda 
(a punch to the cyclist), 
njshiki·geri (a kick to the 
bicycle ), and the highly 
effective oi·yoko·geri-sh i111011 0, 
a lateral kick to the vu lnerable 
derailleur area. If cycle and 
rider are down but not out, the 
first attack can be followed by 
the coup de grace, kampi-
stomp;, which can take out the 
most expensive equipment 
in tantly. 

One other technique taught 
by several schools is poki·spoki, 
which involves thrustin$!: an

Architecture 
continued from page 5 
of other projects, each working its way 
toward completion. 

A $9 million parking structure is 
pending for University Hospital , a part 
of UCSD although located nearer to 
downtown San Diego. A recreation 
facility, with swimming pool, is 
underway just east of Central Library 
and gradmg has been finished for a $5 
million struction at Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography , while the plans have 
yet to be finalized . 

For every project that is brought to 
completion, hundreds are killed at 
various stages in their design. One 
such casualty was a new campus for 
Warren College. 

Warren had the misfortune to be 
housed in residual military buildings 
in 1974. Built during World War Two 
as part of the now·defunct Camp 
Matthews Marine Base, the buildings 
are inadequate to serve as a true 
college facility, but when the cash ran 
out there was little alternative. 

The UCSD Guardian 25 

The UCSD se rvic e s hop s 
(Corporation Yard) slice down the 
middle of the Warren campus, further 
detracting from a unified , academic 
environment. To the east of the shops 
lie contemporary student apartments. 
while to the west, classrooms and 
administra tive facilities are housed in 
decaying. military·style quonset huts 
and bungalows. 

pholo by Mlchatl S ltl·tns 

A sharp cont ra st to the aged and 
undeveloped facilities of Warren 
College is provided by the nearby 
Ce n t ral University Librar y. 
Mushrooming out of the trees, Central 
has become something of a local 
landmark . Students and tourist alike 
are often seen nearby, camera in 
hand, posing in front of the structure. 
Designed by Bill Perrera, who later 
went on to draw up the Transamerica 
Pyramid in downtown San Francisco, 
the library is an architectural focal 
point on campus. 

The creation of new faci lit ies for 
UCSD is an ongoing concern and it is 
doubtful that construction will ever 
come to completion. As the campus 
draws nearer its full size, however, 
cash shortages and an uncertain 
future make any speculation on the 
architectural future here extremely 
difficult. 

Back in the Office of De ign and 
Construction, Charles Power tares 
across his cluttered desk . From behind 
a pair of rose·tinted eyeglasses, he 
ays, "I get a lot of satisfaction out of 

working with my staff , and despite the 
trauma that comes with this territory, 
I enjoy the job."
