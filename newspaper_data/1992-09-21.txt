In addition. legal action against the c<HlpS has been

The action will result in three possibilities: inunediale 
eviction of the co-ops from campus, eviction this Octo-

Following the initiation of legal action, Holmes said,

expect to pay much higher fees. possibly as 
early a~ next quarter. because of a massive cuI 
in state funding to the university. 

The $224 million cut from last year's fund-

support services, and faculty. according to 
university offICials. The Board of Regents is 
also considering drastic cuts in enrollment. 

According 10 acting Director of the UC 
Student's Associalion (UCSA) Andy Shaw. 
the cuts were equal to the oper.llions budget of 
one and a half of the smaller UC campuses.

A Note to the Ra .... 
As the UCSD Guardian resumes publ ication 

for the 1992-93 academic year, retuming 
students will notice that the newspaper has 
undergone some significant changes during the 
summer break. 

The paper is sporting a new masthead. and 
with It an entirely new design. These changes are 
more than just cosmetic. It is the goal of the 
Guardian to break new ground in its coverage of 
campus events. The dark ages of reactive 
joumalism have passed. 

This year, the editors hope to present 
information in a more simple and reader·friendly 
manner. New and retuming students alike will 
find increased attention paid to investigative and 
in-depth stories about important issues affecting 
their everyday lives. 

But we can't do it all. If you see or hear 
something you find outrageous, or praiseworthy, 
or both. we urge you to call it to our attention. 
And for those students who may aspire to a 
career in journalism, or peftlaps merely wish to 
write for their campus paper for the sheer 
ertO)'ment Of it, we invite you to stop brt our 
offices on the second floor of the Old Student 
Center, above the General Store Co<lp, and 
check us out. 

No experience is necessary, but newcomers 
are s~ urged to attend the Guardian Writing 
Irtemship Program, a short series of seminars 
produced brt the editors to help tIedgI~ writers 
dINeIop a solid joumallstlc style. Look for ads in

New AquariUDl-MuseUDl Opens on Scripps Crunpus 
By Francisco DeVries 
News Editor 

The new Slephen Birch Aquarium-
Museum was "launched" in a fe:.live 
ceremony for long-time patron~ and 
benefactors of the Scripps Aquarium 

1~IMonday. [t wasopened tOlhe public 
on Wednesday. 

The $14 million dollar facility on the 
ripp campw. w~ uted by Scripp~ 
ln~tirule of Oceanogrnphy Director Ed-
W'JJ1.i Frieman ~ "your window II1to our 
I\orld.'· 

Frieman ex~ his hope:.th.1l the 
quarium-Museum will give the public 

a better 1001< into "the fragile link be-
tween man and nature." 

llle Scripp' lnstitule has Oper.lIed an 
aquarium and museum since 1905. The 
latest is almost three times the , ize of irs 
predecessor and holds 1500 more fi 'h in 
its33 display tanks. The previous Scripps 
Aquarium had been in operation since 
1951. 

CO-OPS: Hope 
fades as university 
files eviction papers 
Continued from page A1 

The co-ops and the admini tration 
were on the verge of coming to an 
agreement early in June. when nearly 
all differences appeared to be ~Ived. 
The agreement would have allowed the 
co-ops to lay on campus as indepen-
dent student groups as long as competi-
liverares would be paid for rent. liability 
insurance, and other expenses. 

According to General Siore Co-op 
Senior O eri< Randy Corpuz, such cosrs 
would have quadrupled the overhead 
which the co-ops currently pay for such 
services. 

Corpuzsaidanagreementwasnearly 
signed, but the admini tration said the 
co-ops could nor. be con idered official 
UCSD student organizations. 

"They brought it up during the sum-
mer that we could not be a student 
organization. But we have to be a ru-
den! organizMionto feel like pan of the 
university," Corpuz said. Co-ops also 
feared that they would be evicted if not 
given student status. 

U[t 's unfonunale that negotiations 
broke down this way - we came so 
close." Corpuz said 

Vice Cbancellor of Undergraduate 
Affairs Joseph Watson also expressed 
dissatisfaction with the tum of negotia-
tions. "1 am deeply disappointed that we 
could not solve [the conflict] in spite of 
the fact that we had an agreement in 
early June." he said 

According to Watson, the co-ops 
cannot be granted student organization 
slatus because it puts the university. and 
thu the tudents, at a Liability risk. 

"A srudent organization which is 
fully on campus has to follow the rules 
and regulations of the university. Other 
off-<:ampus vendors have total inde-
pendence. They are fully accountable 
and can in no way imply that they 
represent the university," Watson said 

By seeking both independence and 
tuclent organization status. the co-ops 

were placing the university in a position 
oflegal responsibility. " When I say the 
university. 1 mean allsrudents." Watson 
added. 

Corpuz maintained that the uni ver-
sity would be at no legal risk. since the 
co-ops' insurance would cover $3 mil-
lion. the amounl of required pnxecrion 
for on-campus rerailers. 

The legal action may also put an end 
10 the i lie, but Corpuz said that a 
failw-eoflhe university's action incoun 
would srill mean the end of the co-ops. 
"I think the university will try to do its 
beSlto evict !he co-ops ... ," he said. 

The highlight of the Aquarium i a 
70.(XX) gallon tank housing a real kelp 
forest and a wide variery of lish. The 
museum side of the facility h;bdetailed 
exhibits explaining eruthquAAC! . wave

SPEAK YOUR MIND IN THE 
GUAPJ)IAN OPINION SECTION 

COMMENI'ARY: To get the most out of this section, Guardian readers should take 
the time to make their voices heard by writing letters and submitting commentaries 

By Philip Michaels 
Opinion Editor 

Opinion i~ prob;lbly the one thing you will receive in abundance 
during your college yea!>. In the next few years. you might find 
yourself swimming in a . ea of opinion. Everyone you encounter-

profe~~ors. TAs, your roommate~ - will have ~ome poin! of view that 
they will be in lined to share with you. 

It' rather fining. then. that opinion is not deficient in the pages of 
thh, new~paper. Since diverse view~ and unique ideas 
are part of the college experience. The UCSD 
Guardian's goal is to feature as many opinion. as 
possible. 

Un like many other college new~papers. the 
Guardian is student-run and funded olely by 
advertising revenue. We don't receive a dime of 
st udent fees. 

These anicles can address just about any topic and are 'olely the 
opinions of the individual authors. By printing a commentary, the 
Guardiall doesn't necessarily endorse the ideas expressed in the 
article. 1l1e author takes respon~ibilit y for his or her viewpoint; we 
merely support his or her right to be heard. 

In fac t. if you disagree with what a commentary has to say. we 
encourage you to 'present your opposing views. The Opinion section 
thrives on the spirit of debate. and for that reason, the Glll/rdiall 

welcomes readers to write leiters to the Editor. 
All leiters must be typed. double-spaced and should 

be no longer than three pages. They should also be 
signed and include a telephone number. To verify a 
leller's validity, the associate opinion editor will 
contact leiter writers to confinn authenticity. The 
Gllare/iall reserves the right to edit leiters for length 
and clarity. 

Letters and commentaries can either be dropped off With only a handful of journalism classe available 
at UCSD, this new~paper is. in itself. something of u 
leaming experience. Guardiall Maff are not only 
gathering and di eminating news for the UCSD 
community. but learning about the proces of newspa-
per production as well. We try to present the informa-
tion that is valuable to you as a student. such as local 
news. ans and entertainment. intercolleg iate and 
intramural sport . 

If you

submissions to: Opinion Editor, GUl/rdial/, 9500

Opinion section so that we may belter serve our 
readership. Regular Columns from all comers of the 
political ~pectrum will be a part of this SC(tion 
throughout the year. We are till seeking additional 
columnists - so any would-be pundits should contact 
the Opinion office immediately at 534-6582, 

w ........... you 
More than any other pan of the newspaper, the 

Opinion section offers the UCSD community an 
opportunity to ound off about a wide range of issues 
and ideas. Since everyone sees things different ly, we 
recognize our re ponsibility to present as many view~ 
and opinions as possible.

To that end, the Opinion section contain a variety

This year, the Opinion section will also feature 
Editorial Cartoons ~ubmi!led entirely by ~tudents. If 
you envision yourself as the neKt Garry Trudeau,

als appear in the lefl column of page four. These are 
un~igned articles which represent the majority posi tion of the Gllardial/ 
Editorial Board - a panel consi~ting of the editor in chief, managing 
editor, news editor, and opinion edi tor. 

The views expressed in editorials are those of the editorial board 
alone. They do not nece~ arily represent the opinions of the remainder 
of the Guardian ~tafr. the As:.ociated Student. the admini tration, the 
UC Regents. or anyone else here at UCS D. 

Commentaries, on the other hand, can be written by students. 
faculty. or :.taff. Any commentary from out ide the Guardiall staff will 
be credited with a "contributing opinion writer" byline. 

Each week, we will prese nt a Focus Section 
devoted to a single, imporumt issue. Focus ~ctions explore lIngle~ 10 
world. nalional, and local events through insighlful commentaries and 
in-depth infonnational graphics. In the upcoming month~, for 
example, we will be focusing on the UC Regents, rJCe and I!thnicity, 
and the November elections. 

The more that studenl~ contribute to the Opinion ~ecti on, the more

HIGHER EDUCATION: 
WHAT'S GoING DOWN 

COMMENI'ARY: The Wliversity is no longer an institution of higher learning, but a 
place where con men and charlatans ply their wares on gullible, unthinking students 

CCWNENrARY: Students must 
act to protect their education rights 
By Ely Rabanl 

TH E: CAVALCADE OF BOOBS 
Contributing OpinIon Writer 

Orientation week i~ rn.ten~ibly a lime \\ hen 
newcomers arc giv~n enough infonnat Ion to navi-
gme the geography and bureaucr.lcy of UCSD. A 
more than healthy dose of waml-fuzzy propa-
g,moo i~ induded. Unfortunately, thi - year a new 
buzz-word will be added to the le\icon of college 
lik dOH I/.\i:illg. A cold prickly truth looll1~ over 
the in~tirution. a. .. well;b alifomia \ public b:l'>ic 
and higher educational ~y~tems. You've heard 
about budget cut:., now you get to see them fir..! 
hand: if your fee:. don't increase in the middle of 
this year, they c~rtainly will by next; classes, 
progmms and maybe even departments could face 
closure; tenured faculty, the lxisis of any quality 
university,could facc layof~. ServicCl> will be cut, 
and a degl\.'e will be that mllch harder to complete. 

lllis biller pill i n'tjUS( one forthis year's new 
students: higher education has been a foundation of 
dem I"JCy and the economy. and they can't be 
expected to fare well without i1. Diversity is also 
mOl'C threatened now than it has been ever since 
desegregation. as evidenced by this year's admis-
ions numbers for African-Americans and ative 

Americans in particular. Total admissions are also 
expected to decline: Larry He~hman, UC Vice 
President for Finance, has been quoled as project-
ing ~lUt enrollments will be ('/II ill half That 's over 
75,(00 students. He has also previously indicated 
that if the State budget's fiscal problems aren't 
resolved, the UCand theCSU facepril'Uli:alioll hy 
liIe year 2000. 

But the point of all of this isn '( to depl'CSl> you. 
It 's only depressing if you do nothing about it. 
Orientations are full of step-by-step guides, so here 
arc the step to defending your higher education. 

- Vote. Students are reputed to be an apathetic 
voting block, and this is why we get the shon end 
of the stick. Register by Oct. 5 and vote on Nov. 3. 
Registration fonns may be ottained at the A.S. 
External Office. You may also obtain infonnation 
on the voting records of incumbents there. 

-Make sure your parents are registered to vote. 
You and they should write your state legislators 
and let them know you care about higher education 
and you vote - and that you're watching them. 

-If you can, attend the Shut Down and Teach-
in at SDSU on Wednesday, September 23. It will 
infonn you on these issues much more thoroughly. 
If not for last year' vigorous student outcry, fees 
would be even higher this year. 

• Look for the petition to recall Gov. Pete 
Wilson. He's dangerous. 

In the '90s, higher education includes political 
~urvival skills. Time to start learning.

Some students go to their lectures ,lIld sit 
cross-legged, eye closed, aml hanging limp in

Behind the screaming gllru~ march the play-
ers - future accoun tant or research assbtants 
who are utterly incapable of any original or 
creative thought. These ,niveling toadie, can be 
found nuzzling the poMerio~ of their instructors 
in hope of proving the old adage, "it ' not what 
you know but who you know." Even the mOM 
feeble-minded can recognize that these people 
are the most despicable of the species and ought 
to be rounded up and sent to a cold and inho,pi-
table place. Instead, we place them in charge of 
universities. The e days. it's hard to tell the 
difference. 

The hucksters in the university's public rela -

reputation as one of the finest public highc:r 
education institutions in the nation, if not the 
world. That may well be true. The problem is 
when people ntistake this reputation for a magi-
cal answer to all of life's problems. llle uni ver-
sity has long since StOPped functioning as an 
institute of higher leaming. It has mutated into a 
veritable cavalcade of boobs and con men intent

LAST RITES FOR THE RECYClING EFFORT 
CC8tENTARY: With newspaper recycling in jeopardy, a new dedication is required 
By DanIel Hurst 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

The new paper recycling elfOfl at 
UCS Di dead. ThaI sentence kills me as 
much a! it kill anyone else because for 
the last two years I have invesled a great 
deal of time furthering the effort of 
recycling at UCSD for the Recycle Co-
op: working witQadministr:llors. con-
cerned tudents. and fonner !>Iudents. I 
could cast blame at someone locally for 
the tennination of the newspaper recy-
cling program. but the issue is IlOI just a 
local problem. It is why "think globally, 
act locally," does not cut it anymore. 

The UCSD Recycle Co-op began 
with a few concerned members of the 
Food Co-op recycling newspaper. IxK:k 
when such a collection actually made 
money. l11e revenue was used to ex-
pand the Recycle Co-op's other efforts. 
However. the newspaper market has 
declined to the point where newspaper 
recycling i IlOI profitable. In facL it is 
highly unprofitable. unless captured in 
large roll-<lffs (like the one fonnerly in 
the Student Center). There isnOlenough 
room to ituate the eight roll-<lffs pro-
jected as neces.-.ary to claim the large 
anlounts of discarded new paper in the 
interior of campu~. There has abo been 
-.evere resistance by the admini~tration 
whenever something it considers to be 
an eyesore has been unceremoniou~ly 
dumped somewhere by my co-op. 

Of course. I could locate roll-<lff all 
overcampu . Bulthat i because I'm of 

theopinionthatsincewecre:uetr:l~h( I 0 
pounds per CaLifornian per day - the 
dirtiest living things on the planet), we 
should have to loolc at the receptacles. 

Why is newspaperllOl profitable for 
recycling? Because virtually no one 
buys recycled newsprint. Allover the 
count!)', it is being stockpiled for sonne 
future time when the U.S. government 
gets off its ass and puts the gun to the 
head of multinational corporate 

America. This is also true of glass. wlla! 
linle plastic is recyc led. tin. and mixed 
paper. Aluminum, white paper. and 
computer paper have seen some recy· 
cling succ . although the market for 
the laner two has decreased to the point 
thai we at the Recycle Co-op spend four 
times as much as we make collecting it. 
In fact. we are right now debating 
whether or not to eliminate recycling 
paper totally since the glass markC( fell 
by half last spring and our current legal 
battle with Joe Watson has 'uckedmuch 
of our other revenue away. 

And what about the Califomia Re-
demplion Value. the two or so cenL~ 
added to the purchase of taxed beverage 
containers, which Wa!S supposed to in· 
crease recycling? Wrong. This tax is 
passed directly to the consumer. from 
multinationalcorpordleAmericatoyou. 
It does nothing to stinnulate recycling 
markets. Iu t because Coke & Pepsi 
have to tag on two cents more per can 
doe n't force them to put recycled ma-
terial into their container.;. All the CRV 
does is inflate the prices recycling cen-
terspay on certain recyclables.the infla-
tion ,temming from a govemmcl1l ~1Ib­

~idy. So not only do YOll the taxpayer 
kick-uptheCRVat thecheck -'(.md.you 

al~ kick-up pan of the redemption r,lte 
when the containers empty. 

Another fact: many recycling cen-
teTh take recyclabl~ and yet throw them 
away. 1l1ey do this because they know 
marketing: that collecting more types 
than their competit r will lure all the 
militant recyclers out to their yard If 
you have nine things to recycle and 
Ted's Recycling Center takes them all, 
whileMike'sonlytakes ix,you'llgoto 
Ted·s.Ofcourse,Tedi throwing away 
recyclables seven, eight and nine. B lit 
you didn 't know. Now you know. so ask 
the people at Mike's Recycling which 
of the stuff they take that they throw 
away. If they balk, ask them who they 

sell their stuff to. since most local recy-
dersare merely somewhere in themiddle 
of the recycling chain. 

So now how do we deal with the end 
of new~paper recycling b.lt'k at UCSD? 

I. Take thc newspaper toa l\.'Cycling

throwing it away.

Atkinson has made frequent complail1~ 
about recycling bin overtlow. and mem·

and Design have alway~ told me that 
although they know recycling is impor-
tant, it doe n't excuse.U1 eyewre.

4.Corvette Diner: 
3946 5th Avenue. 

Hillcrest. Phone: 542-

1001. This restaurant 
amusingly seeks to bring 
us back to the '50s with 
the music, decor, and 
other annoying attributes 
of that over -rated era. The 

food is good, very hearty 
to say the least - the 
size of the portions 
makes it a decent value 

for the dollar. The Diner 
merits a visit merely for 

the experience of a loud-
mouthed waitress throw-
ing your straws at you. 
Se warned that the wait 
for a table on weekends 

is very, very, very long.

town. Phone: :!34-:!739. Located in 
the hean of downtown S;lIl Diego, 
StrJuss' offers what may well be 
the finest dining experience a slu-
dent can have without spending a 
small fonune. StrJuss' feels like an 
upscale neighborhood bar, with 
friendly service and an all-around 
jovial atmosphere. For a fun night 
out with friends, the Old Columbia 
Brewery can'tbe beat. But i(you're 
planning a quiet. romantic supper . . 
you may want to go elsewhere. As 
the name suggests, Str.tuss ' is both 
a restaurant and a worl.ing brewety. 
It produce~ more than 14 different 
tx-ers. mnging from ve:ry light to 
very dark. Strau~s' Amber Lager is 
the ale of choice - full-bodied. 
very . mooth. and no bitter after-

eled with what could be the spiciest

Adirondacks. The slightest whiffo( 
it will make youreyes water uncon-
trollably. But one cannot go to 
StrJuss' without experiencing the 
ribs, 1lle babyback rib are easily 
the best thing on the menu. 1lJe 
meal consists of a whole s lew of 
ribs, a mountain offries. and a scoop 
of slaw. This is no exaggeration. 
Those with even the heartiest appe-
tites are advised to avoid a large 
lunch if they are planninganevening 
at the Old Columbia Brewery. A 
half-slab cost a paltry $7.95, and a 
full s lab is on ly $1 0.95. If you have 
room for dessert. try the tlourless 
chocolate cake. [t is essentially a 
super-rich chocolate brownie. 
topped with a dollop of whipped 
cream and bathing in a layer of 
raspberry sauce. It's an intense 
chocolate experience that should 
not be attempted on a fu II stomach. 
If you go. play it safe and make 
reservations. The pl.ICe is usually 
pretty busy on weeke:nds. Also. a 
bou,ncer is occasionally posted at 
the front door. If you plan to dine at 
Stmuss' but you <lre unde:r 2 I. have 
no fear. Simply assure the doorman

about a pound. not counting all of 
the extra tuffsloppedon topofil. A 
large order of french fries is enough

number of different burgers and hot 
dog. Thehealrh-con cious ('lhem!) 
may want to try the California 
burger. which is topped with avoca-

ven turous should take the plunge 
into the "Mayor Daley Burger," a 
monstrous hunk of ground beef 
topped wltham~ slvescoopofchili

take their lean burgers and sa lad

How secure is 
your future in 
computing? 

Atoday's veteran programmers are watching their jobs being outsourced to the far corners of the earth, you can't help but ask yourself, "is there a secure future in programming?" 
In Decline and Fall of t he Amer ican Programmer, Ed 
Yourdon demonstrates how U.S. software organizations can 
beeome world class shops if they exploit the key software 
technologies of the 1990's. Companies and programmers 
that master these new technologies can be sure of superior 
productivity and quality -- and those that don't won't be 
here when the 21st century starts.

Continued from page A1 
hi, office "felt mo~t of the R."C mmen-
dation, were ba;,ed on ju,t u few in· 
,tance, lof imprudent conduct]." 

cting eC'utive Dircclor of the 
ue tudent A.'~lulion Andy Shaw 
-aw the audit in adiffcrent light. how-
evcr. "The Audit r Geneml is very 
cautiou~. When [he ~ly~lthat some-
thing i, I10t prudent it is u very big 
,lap." he said. 

ccording to Shaw, mostcorporJ-
tions began a streamlining process 
that removed many executive perks 
over the last five years to save money 
during the economic downturn. "ue 
did not jump on that bandwagon." he 

~id, "There are a IO! of things that 
univen;ityofficialsarespending money 
on that they shouldn't be spending 
money on:' 

Included in theuudit were specific 
concerns about the useofthe "Admin-
istrJtive Fund," which was designed 
fortopadmini lr.ltorstouseinwooing 
potential top employees and donor.;. 
The auditor.; found that much of that 
money may have been used for per-
-onal and intra-office activities. 

For example, 59 percent of the 
events hosted by Senior Vice Presi· 
dent Ronald Brady wi th administr.:t-
ti ve fundl> were reserved for employ-
ees oftheOftic~ of the President only. 

The audit cited one example in 
whi h Vice President William Baker 
hosted u dinner party at university 
e>.pense tocelebmtethe weddingof an 
Office of the President employee for 
approximately 75 member.;ofthestaff. 
'The auditors stated that "we believe 
the ue would derive greater benefit 
from ho ting academically related 
meetingsorentertainingofficialguests 
or poIential donors dla/1 from enter-
taining only individuals under its em· 
ploy." 

West defended the pol icy of allow-
ing such spending. The Office of the 
President is not allowed to give be-
nusesorothersuchperks. he said. and 
that party, a~ well as other.; like it, are 
important for "employee morale pur-
poses .. , like a hoUday pany." 

The audit also stated that top ex-
ecutives were nO! using accrued sick 
and vacation leave when not reporting 
for work, "According to theirengage· 
ment calendars and leave records for 
January 1989throughAprill992,alJ 
six individuals we reviewed failed to 
repon absences related to illness or 
medical appointments [when absent 
for short increments]." 

UeSpokespe~ Michael Lassiter 
said that reporting leave was not al-
ways required becauseadministrdtive 
salaries were based on a di fferent sys-
tem than a strJight eight-hour work 
day. and that top executives did not 
receive overtime pay. "You 're sup-
posed to work until the job is done. ,. 
you make up [lost time] along the 
way," he said 

Another of Sjoberg's concerns 
mentioned in the audit were the ho~­
ing arrangements made for Gardner. 
TIle audit stated that Gardner wa~ 
exempted from living in univer.;ity 
housing and was given a housing al-
lowance to purcha<,e and maintain his 
own home. 

The univer.;ity also agreed to buy 
his previous home in Utah and pro-
vided himwithamongageloanforhis 
new home in Orinda, the audit foWld. 

"[DJuringPresidentGan1ner's ten-
ure, several elements of the original 
housing pack.age changed, often re-
sulting in additional benefit to Presi-
dent Gardner and costs to Uc. , . . [ Ad-
ditionally] the UC may have paid 

President Gardner more for the UtM 
hometh..'U1the valueofhisequity in it ," 
the repon stated 

TIle Office of the President re-
ponded that it will review propeny 

puR'hases I110re carefully in the future. 
but that Gardner's benefi t ~ \\ ere an 
approprime part of the "".'cruitmcnt 

px~uge" at the time Gardner wa~ 
hired. 

me changes in policie>. and pro-
cedures have already bt'en inMituted 
by Gardner in re~pon.-.e to the audit. 

In u leiter to the BOUI'd of RegenL<; 
earlier this month. Gardner defended 
the U!.e of "Admini tr:.ltive Funds" tL, 
"important work... undertuken no! 
for the benefit. conveniencl:. or wel-
fare of the individual officer but forthe 
benefit, convenience, and welfare of 
the University of Cali fomi a and. thus. 
ultimately the people of California." 

Also contained in the letter, how-
ever. were new guidel ines for the usc 
of the disputed funre. Among the 
clarification was a re~triction b.'\Jl-
ningmost first class airtravel, a ban on 
the purchase of personal gi fts with

mentation of benefit t the univer.>ity

What the Audit Says 
• "VICe President Baker hosted a 
reception and dinner to celebrate 
the wedding of an Office of the 
PreSident employee at the VICe 
PreSident's home In Orinda In July 
1990. Approximately 75 
members of the Budget and 
Ulliverslly RelatIOns staff attended 
this event at a cost of $2,628." 
• -We found that It was not 
always clear whether all contribu-
tIOns and gifts paid from the 
AdministratIVe Fund were made on 
behalf of the UC, as polICY 
requires, or only on behalf of the 
Individual making the contnbutlon 
or gift: 
• -We also found several 
instances where, we believe, 
executives, including President 
Gardner. claimed unnecessary 

Iodgi~ expenses. For example, In 
July 1991. President Gardner 
stayed at the Four Seasons Clift 
Hotel in San Froocisco for two 
nights dunng meetings of the 
regents at a cost to the UC of 
$370. While the trip was for 
offICial meetings, the location of 
the meetings was only about 10 
miles from the UC's Oaklartd 
headquarters .-
• -.. ,since he began serving as 

the UC President. the UC has paid 
PreSident Gardner an average of 
$25,020 per year as his housing 
allowance, for a total of $210.585 
through December 31, 1991,-
• "The regents recently approved 
changing the vesting dates on fIVe 
of the Nonquahfied Deferred 
Income Plan (NDIP) agreements 
with President Gardner, Thus, 
when he resigns on December 31. 
1992, the UC will pay him an 
estimated $492,607 In settlement 
of his NDIP agreements Instead of 
the $60.850 it would otherwise 
have been obligated to pay . .. . We 
found that materials presented to 
the regents were not always 
specifIC as to the amounts that 
would octually be paid. Conse-
quently, we could not conc lude 
that the regents knew the full 
extent of what they were approv-
ing .. : 
• -Purchases of wine and other 
alcoholic beverages for the Blake 
House supply were also funded 
through the AdministratIVe Fund. 
For example. In August 1990, 
President Gardner's allocation 
from the AdministratIVe Fund paid 
$4,133 for wine for the Blake 
House:

Stay Tuned For 
the Geritol 
Tennis Challenge 

Mid-September is one of my favorite 
time:. of the year for sports. e:.pecially this 
year. So many exciting sports events 
happening simultaneously. The pennant 
mces and the pro and college footba 11 
~ns are underway. Hockey preseason 
is days away while pro basketball tr.lining 
camps open MXlfI. And. best of all. the 
Dodgers are mathematically eliminated 
from the pennalll race. 

Speaking of the Dodgers. Pedro 
Astado is the next candid;lle for a career-
threatening :urn injury. 

Think about Valenzuela. Hershiser. 
Ramon Martinez; A~tacio is the next great 
pitcher in the Dodger organization who 
will pitch like a Hall of Farner for five or 
ix years. and then his aml will fall off. 

Literally. Here's Vin Scully's call : 
"Astacio has pitched a marvelous game. 
He checks the runner at frrst base. Here' s 
the pitch. The ball gets away from 
Piazza. Pedro's arm gets away fronl 
Piazza." Can you real ly blame Lasorda 
for overworking his ace pitchers? When 
was the last time the Dodgers had a 
reliable bullpen? I think it was 19O-l.

inniguing event The handicap: Connors 
gets only one serve. Martina gets half of 
each double alley. However, both 
players will be permined Geritol breaks

march won't be that competitive. Connors 
will devour Navratilova's serve, and he'll 
hold serve enough to win. NavrJlilova 
has a great net game. but her slice 
backhand will be punished severely. 

Although he' forty years old, Jimmy 
will win, or he'lI die trying. Seles vs.

Mike Yen holds off his Cal State Stanislaus opponent, but the Warriors were able to punch through the Triton defense for two scores. 

Stanislaus Upends UCSD 
MEN'S SOCCER: Waniors take 
advantage of Tritons' defensive 
lapses to escape with a 2-1 victory in 
double overtime 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Sports Editor 

It was the M:vemh ganle of the year. but the 
UCSD men's ~occer team looked 3.'> if it w3.'> ju~t 
starting the Se:t.'>On. Defensively sh:tky. the Tritons 
were underwhelming in dropping a 2-1 decision to 
Division IJ Cal St3leSuUlisiaus in adoubleovenime 
nail-biter. 

The game wa~ even through lhe first half. with 
boIh teams battling for control but neither sustain· 
ing it It was a ign of things 10 come for UCSD 
when Triton goalie Michael Madden came out of 
the goal on a Warnor breakaway and knocked lhe 
ball clear of the goal. Stanislaus would get more 
opportunities later on as the Triton defensive lapses 
continually put Madden one-on-one with an on-
rushing Warrior attacker. 

UCSD got its best chance of the finot half at the 
24:36 mark when Sergio Salvador took a bouncing 
pass 15 yards from the goal. turned and fired. just 
missing to the right 

The beginning of the second half was more of 
the same. with both teams unable to establish a 
continuous offensive threat. Then the Tritons took 
control at 64:45 when Nick Terlecky centered the 
ball from the right side. Brent Egusa went high for 
the ball, heading it back across the goal, bouncing 
itrighr toJa.rret Stevenson. Stevenson headed it past 
Warrior goalkeeper Isidro Duque for the game's 
r lJ'St score. 

UCSD held on for seven minutes before Cal 
State Stanislaus responded with Roben Sargisian

Just three minutes later UCSD had another close

The first overtime was as much of a see-saw as 
regulation was, with the exception of Stanislaus pick-
ing up two yellow cards. 

With boch teams tiring. Stanislaus had a chance 10 
end it 4:30 into the second overtime, when the War-
riors' Marvin Ron had yet anodter one-on-one with

"These committees, represented

According to Brandenburg. not 
only are UCSD and SDSU integral

instructors at the MBAC are San 
Diego-area university students or 
affiliates, including staffers from 
UCSD. "The center truly is run by 
the two universities from top to bot-

Funding for the MBAC comes 
from tipends from SDSU and

you'd find at other place~." 

The MBAC's facilities are con-
~ idered to be among the finest in the 
nation, said Bruce Rifkin, mainte-
nanceandoperations,upervbor. He 
noted that the MBAC'), de~ign is 

u~d a.\ a model for other aquatic 
cemers. "I talked with the director 
of Sacramento State 's aquatic cen-
terrecently, and he told me the same 
thing I hear from centers all overthe 
country. They all wish to be like the 

Mi~sion Bay Aquatic Center. It's a 
model center." 

Brandenburg echoed these sen-
timents, adding that the center is 
blessed by its location. 

" Mission Bay is the largest and 
beSt developed water spons area in 
the world. It 's in as ideal a spot as 
you can ger. ··

"Our boats are us~d more in a

boms in a year. 

"Wehavetoen urelhatthemain-

heavy use, the equipment stays in 
"good repair," he added. 

The MBAC's information guide 
states that over 15,000 people par-

special events at the center. Accord-

while SDSU's students make up

The UCSD men 's and women 's 
crew teams train at the MBAC dur-

There are a few things for Padre f<ll"b 
to heer about this year. 

The Padres have four star.;: Fred , 
McGriff launching prodigiously loog ,

league, Tony Gwynn having another 
typically solid (and typically injury-
plagued) season, a Triple Crown con-
tender in Gary Sheffield. and brilliant 
Slralegist Greg Riddoch guiding his 
charges to victory with his ma.slerful 
dugout decisions. 

Wouldn'titbesomethingtoseeTim 
Wakefield win a couple of playoff and 
World Series games for the Pirates? 
That is truly a gre:u sports tory. Every-
body loves Tim Wakefield except op-
~ing hitters and his catcher, who has

heck, I was making contact in the 70

dances more than Michael Jacksoo, 
making major league batters look very 
foolish. 

The highly esleemed academic in-
stitution (sic) across town has the most 
explosive running back in the nation. 
Congratulations to Marshall Faulk., a 
marvelously gifted running back and by 
all accounts, a great guy too. Hopefully, 
the Aztecs will have a Holiday Bowl 
season and Faulk. will be the first s0pho-
more to win the Heisman. 

Hey, at least they have a football 
team. Wouldn't it be great 10 see the 
mighty Tritons lace 'ern up and revive a 
long-lost gridiron tradition'? UCSD ver· 
sus Miami in the Orange Bowl. Well 
maybe UCSD versus Miramar College 
would be a good place 10 start. 

Speaking of college football (and 
why not, ince I've spoken about every-
thing else in !his column), I'll bel the 
Oklahoma Sooners are feeling pretty 
SlUpid. Big favorites against USC, they 
choked big time. This proves once again 
that the Sooners are overrated. because 
the Trojans aren't that good.

The Yotmg and the Restless 
WOAEN'S SOCCfJt Tritons roU in season opener, but 
experienre a question marl< for Wltested squad 
By GreggWrem 
Sports Editor 

It's time to grow up. fast. 
That 's more than a goal for the 1992 

UCSD women's soccer learn, it's a 
necessity. 

After advancin& 10 the Final Four 
last season. the Trilons were decimated 
by graduation and have only three re-
lurning stlrlers. Those three, Kary 
Dulock, Jodie Robertson and Eva 
Kingsbury, will becounled on 10 lead a 
Icam that has 10 frestunen, six or seven 
of whom may end up as starters for 
UCSD. 

However, with four str.tight Final 
Fourappearances, this team has SOdool i-
nated Divisioo lll socrer that even with 
a young team the Tritons are still the 
prohibitive favorite in the western re-
gion. 

Despite the reputation. Head Coach 
Bryan McManus is still uncertain of his 
team's futw'e. 

'"I'd say we're 30% behind where 
we were last Yell"," McManus said 
"Bul this team has the potential to be jusl 
as good as last yell" if I10l belter." 

"We'll be counting on the veter.ms 
even more Ihan usual to help oul be-
cause it is such a young tearn,"he addt.-d. 

Among those freshmen are two goal, 
keepers trying to step into lhe space left 
by last year's keeper, Jennelle Welling, 
who recorded 13 shutouts. One of the 
two, Cui Schwartz. was in the goal for 
the Trilons first game, a 9"{) laugher 
over Occidental. Schwartz could have 
taken a lunch out to the goal with her, as 
her teammates ran roughshod over the 
Ti gers,l1Ol allowing a hot on Schwartz 
all day. 

Carin Pugh had three goals for 
UCSD, while Dulock, the only forward 
left from last year's team, chipped in 
with four assists. DaphneFamumshared 
the team scoring lead with Pugh by 
knocking in two goal and assisting on 
two others. 

"That was a gimme game," 
McManus said. "We still can't really 
lell how we're going ro play later in the 
season." 

Besides the open goalie position. 
another freshman McManus expects 10 
make an immediate impact ismidfielder 
Mandy Johnson. "She's a real player 
and is going to make a difference this 
yell"." McManus will have to wail a 
while 10 see how much of a difference 
though; Johnsoo was held out of lhe 
Occidental game with an ankle injury. 

Fmding oul how they're going to 
play when they meet some real compe-
tition is a primary concern right now f~r 
the coach. The Tritons have three games 
remaining before what McManu calls 
·'the real season," a four game set with 
Divison II rival Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. Division I UC ' . another 

The You", Tritons blasted their 
way to a ~ victory, 

Dan McDowell! Guanlian 

Oivison II foe in Cal Stale San Bernar-
dino, and finally a tangle with Cal 
Luther.m, the only Division m west 
regioo learn that could challenge the 
Tritons. 

But UCSOcan 'I afford to look ahead 
just yet. They begin a two-game lour of 
the Lone Star stale loday with a game at 
Division II St. Mary's, and then do 
bailie with Trinily Univer ity on 
Wednesday. 

''They're going to be lough games, 
because we don'l know a thing about 
either one of those teams," McManus 
said. 

These games will give the coach 
furtheropportunitylosee how h is young 
players respond to his high-oct:Ule of-
fense. 

l.aSI year the Tritons scored 65 goah 
in 18grunes. themoSl of any telJ"n in 13.'>1

COACIING CHANGES: 
Track, cross COW1IIy and 
diving pick up new bosses 
By Gregg Wrenn 
Sports Editor 

Even with !he athletes on vacalion, 
the UCSD athletic departmclll had a 
busy summer, hiring three new head 
coaches for cross counrry, diving and 
!laCk and fJeld. 

Taking over for fooner cross coun-
tryheadmanMarkStanforthi TedVan 
ArsdaIe, who served as head coach at 
Mesa junior coUege from 1986-89 and 
is director of the UCSD Masters Run-
ning Program. Van Arsdale, who takes 
over a men' team that placed 11th at 
the national meet las! year while the 
women picked up 12th. likes what he 
sees so far from the Triton .• This is a 
m1ented, tighl knil group," VanArsdale 
said 

He credit former coach Mark 
Stanforth, who left to take a job as head 
cross country coach and assistanl track 
coach at the Air Force Academy. with 
much of the learn's ucccss. "[ watched 
[Stanforth] do his work, and he did a 
greal job building the progr.un." Van 
Arsdalesaid To that end, the newcooch 
says he isn't going to change much. " It 
would be unwise 10 to change the estab-
lishment now. There won'l bea bre.1k in 
continuity, but I'm going to make them 
work harder than they ever have be· 
fore," Van Arsdale guamnteed. 

Stanforth's dep;uture also left a void 
in the tmckand field coach position. one 
which assistant coach Tony Salerno 
was only too happy 10 fill . Salerno had 
been an assistant since 1987 under 
Stanforth. 

Salerno's previous pecialty was as 
a throwing coach and supervisor of the 
Tritons' Slrength and conditioning. He 
has coached UCSD's throwe~ into A11-
American hono~ 19 times in his five 
yean; as an assistant and turned the 
program into the most dominant Divi-
sion ill throwing team in the counrry. 
Most notable of those team membe~ 
was Scott Sargeant, a two-time national 
champion in the hammer throw and 
qualifier for the Olympic Trials earlier 
this year in New Orleans . 

As head coach, Salerno realizes that 
his job is mostly administrative. "more 
closely involved with facilitating the 
assistant coaches; I don't go out and teU 
them what to do." In addition, he will 
continue as !he throwing coach. 

Salerno takes over a program that is 
better than ever. "I think the women can 
Slay in the top six in the country, where 
they've been the last few years. The 
men are still getting better. This may be 
their best year ever, even bctterthan last 
year." 

The only one of the new coaches to 
come from outside the San Diego area is 
the new diving coach,Mike Fitchett. A 
four-time All-American at ClUco Stale, 
Fitchett was the head man at Clemson 
for five years. 

Fitchett had a couple of reasons for 
making the move from Division I 
Clemson to the smaller Division ill 
UCSDprogram. "FII'St of all. this isa lot 
c1oserlOour families. But [ also felt I had 
accomplished all [ could at Clemson 
and Division I. It's not as much pres-
sure, !he focus is much more of promoc-
ing the student alhlete [at UCSDI." 

The difference in atmosphere ex-
tends beyond just academics. "Clemson 
is a rural area, and the people are more 
interested in football and basketball. 
Out here. diving is a big time sport," 
Fitchett said 

Fitchetlrepbces Tom Scotty, who is 
now an assistant at UD..A. and director 
of the Rose Bowl Aquatics center.

How to 
Become 
Legendary 

Don'l try these at home. Here are jUSl 
a few of the collegiale legends Ihat have 
become popular on campuses across the 
country. 

• The Cadaver Ann: A group of 
medical students are said 10 have stolen an 
ann from a cadaver at a lab in their 
university and sewn a dollar bi II to its 
hand. Then they drove to a nearby toll 
booth, after insening the ann and its bill 
inlo the sleeve of the jackel of the driver. 
When the lo ll taker grabbed at the money. 
she unwittingly pulled the whole arm out 
of its leeve and was left in shock holding 
the dead limb as the car of laughing med 
srudents ped off. 

• The Trained Proressor: Putting 
what they had learned to good use, a class 
of psychology students decided to practice 
behavior modifICation on their profe.w>r. 
Whenever he placed his hand in his coat, 
the class wou ld nod attentively. take 
copius llOles, and generally try 10 look _ 
interested. O\herntise. they would act 
more naturally, looking around the 
classroom and talking mnongst them-
selves. By the end of the quaner. the 
professor was habilually lecruring with 
one hand stuck in hi coat like Napoleon . 

• The Unsolvable Sbtistics Problem: 
A rudenl walked into class lale and saw 
two statistics problems written on the 
blackboard. Assuming they were a 
homework assignment he copied them 
into his notebook and struggled through 
them later that night. After he turned in 
their correct solutions. the professor 
excitedly called him inlo his office. It 
turned out lhat the two problems had only 
been used in the lecrure as exmnples of 
statistics problems that were thoughllo be 
impossible 10 solve. 

• The Road Worker Scam: A group 
of rudents approached a crew of road 
repairmen and told them to ignore any 
policemen who mighl come to leU them to 
SlOp working. because they would only be 
students in disguise attempting a prank. 
Then lhe group called Ifie local police 
department and reported that a crew of 
student pranksters disguised as road 
workers were ripping up lhe asphalt 

- David Snow 

Monday, September 21 , 1992 

Have I ever told you about this friend of 
mine? He was taking an exam al a large 
university a few years l:xJck, in a lecture halJ full 
of students. AI the end of the alloned time, the 
professor called for all the blue books 10 be 
handed in inlmediately. But while the other 
students were turning in their exmns and walking 
out, he continued to wrile hurriedly for another 
minute or so before walking to the front of the 
empty lecrure hall and turning in his blue book. 

''I'm sony, but I'm going to have to give you 
a failing grade for turning your exmn in late." 
said the professor. 

After much noisy and frui lless arguing with 
the stubborn professor. my friend finally asked. 
"Sir, do you know what my nmne is?" The 
professor replied indignanlly, "No. 1 don'!." 

. 'Good! " said my friend, and he thrusl his exanl 
into the middle of the hundreds of other blue 
book.~ in the stack, and walked out. 

Did this ever aClually take place? For years 
college ~ludenlS across Ihe country have heard 
this slOry in different variatiolts. sometimes told 
as a joke. sometimes as a true occurrence. II is 
just one e;.;ample of cmnpus folklore. It's a tale 
that circulates on campus because it strikes a 
nerve with students everywhere. Anyone who 
has had to deal with a large, impersonal college 
class or an aloof, mean-spirited professor will 
invariably smirk at the conclusion of this story. 

Every univelliity campus has its own 
folklore. Often the only truth 10 be found in 
Ihese collegiate myths is in whal they show 
aboul the attitude and psychology of the students

StJICmE: Final Erit author 
Derek Hwnphty fights for 
landmarl<. euthanasia law 
By Ben Freund 
Features Editor 

Derek Humphry knows how to pi I:: hi 
poisons. The author of the srunningly explicit 
suicide how-to book Final £\it and founder of 
the Hemlocl:: Society revealed at UCSD's 
Bookstore Wednesday how he hopes 10 help 
lenninally ill people who wanl to die but cannol. 

Celebrating the rele:t.e of the paperbacl:: 
version of his book and the recent priming of il~ 
half-millionth copy, Humphry appeared 
e>.tremely passionate as he di:.cu~ the 
upcoming vote on State Proposition 161, the 
California Death with Dignity Act. lPIe:t.e see 
box. page SI9.) 

'"We believe it will pass," he says of the 
ground-breaking measure which would make it 
legal for a terminally ill per.;on to ask a 
physician for aid- in~ying. 

The book sparked a renewed international 
interest in the emotional debate over euthanasia 
last year and became an ovemight best -seller 
after its first review appeared in The Wall Street 
JOlll7lal. Most people didn't know what to make 
of the shocking work, which featured a graphic 
description of a dozen different methods of 
raking one's own life and even included a drug 
dosage table complete with a column listing the 
recommended number of tabletS. 

"I've been criticized for putting those things 
in, but I had to put them in to point out the 
drawbacks," Humpluy say in an interview after 
his appearance. "You'd be surprised that many 
people don't think about those. The only method 
I recommend is the careful use of drugs. and

" fhe language is straighrforwaro and blunt. 
The type is big. It' not a greal work of I ilerature 
by any means. It doesn't deal with philosophy. 
emotion, and ethics." 

Humphry advises readers who are looking

MYTHS: The 
tories behind the 

legends on campus 
ContInued from page Sl1 
lhe United Stales. yet sadly (or maybe 
nOl. depending on how cold· blooded 
you are) the "rule" i~ true on none of 
lhem. The orticialline from UCSD 
administrati n: no such policy exiSlS. 

suppo!>edly cre:ued The Hump. thai 
pesky obstacle to ~Iudent activism. 
with all the extra din from consuuc· 
tion. The intent was Ihat a hump 
would keep the area from becoming a 
gathering place for ~udent demon· 
wations. After all. who ever heard of 
Tiananmen I lump? 

The Facts: The reality i ... that . ., 

deep-seated mi~ of the minis· 
trdlion. The legends often portr.ly a . 
"brutal and inhumane bureaucratic 
y!>tem" and even suggesr"the 

prospect of war between stude.-s and 
the administration." The three 
panicular myths debunked above 
have been circulating at UCSD for 
year.., say Davis. Their endurance on 
campu!. !.haws that ~udent:.· views of 
the administr:uion have 001 changed 
ignifJCalltly over time. 

TAs maybe five. 
The Myth: The annual UCSD 

Watennelon Drop ~ initialed by a 
group of fun· loving phy~ic ~uclents 
who had just taken a final exam Wilh 
a question which lWced them to 
predict how far the funhest waler· 
melon seed would land if one of the 
mammoth fruits were dropped from a 
t'en:lin heigh/. 

The Facts: This is the ven;ion you 
heard on the campus tour, bul one The enonm~ popularity of Ihis 

rumor may renect a su~icion among 
!ltUdenu that grJeb are detenmined 
arbitrarily. This same mistrust has 
fueled other popular ~ories about 
professors who let their famil y 
members grJde exams. directing the 
~mallest child (who works lhe 
,Iowe:.t) 10 mark lhe "A"l.. or who 
Ihrow e~ .. ay IC!.IS down a ~Iairwell and 
grJde them acconling 10 the ~Iep on 
whi h I hey land. 

U SD', decentralized layout is a 
prodUCI of the Regenl~' attempt to 
create a college l>~em simi lar to that 
of lhe Brilish higher educalion 
sySiem. In fact. according to Polilical 
Science Prof~<,()r Sanford Woff. the 
university' initial planning took place 
during the 1950s. before the ri!oC of Heard tftis one? 
student radicalism. and at a time when 

Bronner says that these kinds of 
rumors are not unique to UCSD. They 
represent a kind of "new lore" that has 
been appearing on campuses recently 
as schools swell in ize and adminis· 
trn1ive complexity. Whereas once the 
most popular campus legends were 
about initiation rituals and athletic 
bravado. now the most often retold 
stories deal with huge autocrJtic 
university ystems. One such myth 
tells of a group of students who used 
an extra application fonm to enroll a 
fICtional student and then saw "him" 
all the way through to graduation with 
an "A" average by footing all his bills 
and taking his exams.

convers:uion with the original 
Watennelon Queen who explained 
that those rascally stude.-s dropped 
the fll'Sl watermelon for no reason 
other lhan to see it explode on the 
p:lVeme"" The re:l'iOIlS behind the 
slicker offICial explan:uion of what 
could be UCSD's grandest lradition 
may have to do with the administra· 
tion being unwilling to accept that 
students had fun without being 
academically motiv:Ued.

lies have become more impc~al. 
'\uicide lore" has ul-.o appeared more 
frequently because of lhe highly 
peMnal and allention~wing nature 
of the act. 

The Facts: UnlC!., there i~ a 
massive cover·up by lhe people at 
Physical Plant Services. this intriguing 
~tory will have to be li~ed a.'> faIM:.

face is subliminally included in the 
Revelle Cafeteria murJ!. 

The Facts: if you happen to see 
lAC s face in the mural. then it's there. 
but don'l blame the original artist. 
Before his death. he reportedly told 
Revelle Dean Ernie Mort that he did

Author Derek Humphry helped his tlrst wife to end her life In 1975.

• No requiremenl to involve

person has requested 10 be pul to

• Without a residency require-
ment. people from outside 
California may come to Ihis M4Ue to 
erxl their lives, and Slate taxpayers 
wi II have 10 pay for their care. 

• 0 psychological evaluation 
of patients is required 10 detennine 
if the decision is being made during 
a lemporary stale of depression. 

• Physicians are not required to 
provide counseling or discuss 
a1temative treatments or options to 
suicide with patients. 

-SOUrce: "No on 161" 

written." 
According 10 Atherton. no 

wimesses are required to be involved 
during two crucial momen~ of the 
process. the times when the pal ienl 
asks the physician for assistance in 
dying, and the moment when the 
person actually dies. The possibilities 
are frightening, she says. 

'"Whal if there are two p:uients in a 
h pitaJ room? The candy striper 
l uld go 10 [he wrong bed (when she 
administers the lethal dose.]"' 

"Somelxxly that" s been told they 
have maybe ~ix months left to live. 
they become depressed. How do you 
"-now when a person hn. .. jW;( six 
months to live? Why not say in the 
Initiative that you have to go to a 
'peci;tlist? You could go to a ·doc-in-
lh<!-Jox: There's no governing 
board. Literally. an allergiM could 
CNi:.t in u physician-a. ..... i!>ted ~uic ide. 
LJnd<!r 161 . death clinics could be set 
lip on every street comer." she says. 

A further defect. Atherton argues, 
IS that there is no clause in the 
mea.-.ure to legislale that loved ones 
must be informed of the :bSisted-
suicide request before the act is 
carried out. ' ''There's a grieving 
process. a process of saying goodbye. 
There's no family involvement," she 
points out. 

"There are some people where 
(physician-assisted suicide) is 
needed," Atherton admits, .. but this is 
very few compared to the number thar 
will be misdiagoosed. There are 
thousands of patients \hal wi U fall 
through the cracks under 161." 

Humphry himself acknowledges 
Ihat "a la of people commit suicide 
before they really need 10. I frnd thai 
understandable, but it"s sad. I've seen 
cases of suicide where I thought. 
'That wasn"( necessary: BUI how do 
I know the personal agony thai person 
was going through? 

"My dream is 10 trash this book," 
Humpluy jokes about Fillol £rif, 
exp~ thal he hopes thal people 
soon wiD be able to go to a doctor for 
help in dying in a lawful and 
COOlpassionare manner. "I bet in 10 
years time litis [dcbareJ will all be 
over."

FALL RITUAL RETURNS TO CAMPUS 
There are plenty of sips that tell us It', fall here at UCSD. No, the 

evergreen trees around campus don't tum amber and brown. No, the 
weather doesn't cool, much. The beaches are still full of sun 
worshipers. No-one Is wearing sweaters, scarves and jackets. 

We celebrate the changing of the seasons a little differently here In 
San Diego because It's alwayS sunny and trees are alway, green. 
Une. at the registrar, crowded beaches and the never ending search 
for a parking spot let us know that fall Is here. 

One of fall ' s traditional rituals doesn't go urHlOtlced around here 
though, and that's college football. We may not have an undefeated 
football team that features a Helaman Trophy candidate, but Tritons 
love their football. And, the opening of the Intramural season Is right 
around the comer. 

The great part about 1M Football Is that you don't have to be ,Ix foot 
five and weiCh 255 to play. The 1M staff offers leacues for everyone 
no matter what size, gender or experience level. There's no reason to 
be on the sidell".. watc:ttlnc this fall tradition. Grab some frIencIa, get 
sl&necl up (see sl&n-up schedule aboye), draw up a couple of.,..ys and 
who knows you could be In one of the bIC bowl tames at the end of the 
season.
