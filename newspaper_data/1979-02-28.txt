Foo.d Fiats 
The Coffee Hut and the campus vendinJ machines don't 

provide the same kind of food, aren't at all similar in the 
way they serve food, and, as anyone who has patronized 
both can tell you, aren't alike in prices either. . 

But, they are aUke in that both are the subject of 
administrative fiats which coUld deprive students of 
flexibility on campus - flexibility to get noD-caf~teria food 
in a non-cafeteria environment, and the flexibility of 
funding the college governments need to continue their 
'service to students. 

Without advance student consultation, Chancellor 
William McElroy has proposed that vending machine funds 
at least temporarily be taken from the c.ollege 
governments, and has worked on closing the Coffee Hut and 
converting it into a dues-supported faculty elub. 

1171 

The two problems are related in another way: the 
vending machine funds are being taken in order to offset a 
huge deficit in Food and Housing Services, for which the 
Coffee Hut is largely responsible. 

Writer IIninformed 

The Coffee Hut, along with other of the campus snack 
bars , cannot continue to operate at a deficit. That it has 
fallen into the red indicates poor management on the part of 
the administration, and the burden should not fall on the 
students . Proper steps should be instituted at those snack 
bars that are losing money in order to bring them into the 

Russell Can't Take It Back 

black, ie., raise prices, cut costs . _ 
If the Coffee Hut should close, it should not be turned into 

a faculty club. On this campus, where space is at a 
premium, it should be given to the AS, who have at least 
some claim of ownership to it, as evidenced by the 
administration's attempts at offering the AS a settlement 
figure for the hut. 

A faculty club is a bourgeois affectation, another bastion 
of apartheid and caste society beliefs in our culture. It 

. should be avoided at all costs. If faculty membeJ's don't 
want to associate with students, they should bring a bag 
lunch and lock themselves irt their offices. 

The AS should fight any move to tum the hut into a faculty 
club. 

To deal with the loss of vending machine funds, the AS WIll 
boycott the machines in the ninth (next) week of this 
quarter. We give our support to the boycott and urge every 
student on this campus to do the same. The AS needs 
evidence of an angry constituency in order to deal with the 
campus administration, and students should be angry 
enough to give that evidence to them. 

Don 't patronize any vending machine next week. Your 
teeth, your health 1md your college government will be in 
better shape for it.

Oliphant's cartoon, reprinted

Chavez Leading Renewed UFW Effort 
By Douglas Foster 
Pacillc News Servicl" 

As television cameras focused on 
Cesar Chavez leading thl\usands of 
farm workers at the funeral of a 
murdered lettuce-cutter last week, 
many Californians must have felt a 
strong sense of deja vu. 

After a long period of relative peace 
in the fields , a month-old United Farm 
Workers strike had suddenly taken on 
the violent drama of earlier farm 
worker patties. A striking farm 
worker had been shot in the face, 
setting 'Jet four days of mass mourning 
in Calilolnia border towns. Growers, 
holding p wilted heads of iceberg 
lettuce <!ngrily charged that Chavez 
and tht. union was out to destroy their 
industry. 

Chav -'i hinted darkly of further 
violence and seemed to be courting 
death Ili self. " We' re going into the 
fields a,n they ' re not going to stop us ," 
he saie!. 'I'll go into the fields , and if 
they wa t to shoot m the:; can shoot 
me,!' 

(Douglas Foster is a stan reporter for 
the Salinas Californian and regularly 
writes on farm-labor fer PNS.) 

Such melodrama was supposed to b 
a thi ng of the past, no longer necesS<! ry 
after the passag of California's Labor 

Relations Act of 1975 which brought 
collective bargaining to the fields for 
the first time. More than 70,000 
farmworkers voted in repre-
sentational elections since the passage 
of the Act, and the UFW grew from 
just 7,000. members to more than 
30,000. . 

Although the UFW successfully 
organized mQst major lettuce 
companies in the rich Imperial and 
Salinas valleys, negotiations over a 
master contract have moved at a 
snail's pace since December. Angry , 
impatient workers. - 4,200 so far -
walked off len imperial Valley farms 
at the height of the harvest season. 

Growers placed radio spot 
Cldvertisements for field workers on 
Spanish language radio, and full page 
ad in the Mexican newspapers. But in 
contrast to previous farm labor 
strikes, they were unable to recruit 
large numbers of strike breakers from 
across the border. A handful of the 
struck growers pooled their token 
harvesting efforts, b'ut they had to rely 
primarily on company supervisors, 
growers ' wives and relative , and a 
few drifters. 

Growers charged that the UFW was 
guilty of strong-arm techniques in 
keeping workers outorthe fields . They 
cited the arrest of five union members 
in Mexicali on charges of setting fire to 

the houses of ~ompany forem~n 
working on Imperial Valley farms. 

The union insisted that education 
and organization on both sides of the 
border should be credited for the 
strikes' success. 

"This is the kind oIstrike organizers 
dream about," Chavez said. "There 
are no ~cabs . " 

The strike also differs from past 
UFW battles in its emphasis on wages. 
The UFW often has struck for mere 
recognition or for changes in worting 
conditions. But this year growers 
quickly admitted that such issues 
were negotiable and said the raain 
obstacle to a new agreement is a wide 
difference over wages. 

UFW strikers demanded a 40 per 
cent wage hike for stooP. labor, 
bringing the minimum hourly wageup 
from $3.75 to $5.25, and the piece rate 
up from .57 to .87 cents- per box. 

This stiff wage demand was a result 
of the union 's past successes. Many 
farmworkers now have job security 
for the fi rst time , including 
unemployment inlurance. Thus, 
increasing numbers of UFW members 
have dropped out of the migrant 
stream to settle into permanent 
agricultural communities. They have 
also begun sizing up their pay again t 
the earnings of other unionized 
produce workers. 

A survey of the food industry shows 
why tile striking lettuce workers are 
grumbling'. Unionized shed workers 
who pack and trim the same kinds of 
vegetables picked by UFW members ' 
will earn a $4.70 minimum hourly 
wage beginning in March. 

Workers stuffing food into cans at 
plants' under Teamster contract make 
$5.58 an hour. The union worker who 
bags vegetables at the supermarket is 
paid $4.13 an hour. And further along 
the food chain , experienced 
supermarket checkers make $8.~ an 
hour. . 

Growers, who propose to keep wage 
raises below President Carter's seven 
percent guideline, call the UFW 
demands ridiculous. "If I were to sign 
their proposal and farm exactly the 
same crop as I have today, the cost of 
labor would be $21jz million dollars 
more next yearthan it was last year," 
says Mario Saikhon, one of the largest 
Imperial Valley lettuce shippers to be 
hit by walkouts. 

" We've worked very hard for what 
we've got, and have had a lot of luck. 
We're not going to blow it all now," he 
says. 

Saikhon bas warned hi workers 
that he'd rather ploueh his fields under 
than sien the UFW contract. He 
recruited company upervi ora,

NEWS BRIEFS 
From the Associated Press 

Saccharin No Health 
Risk, Report Says 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a new review of old director. 

data, a scientific group says saccharin poses no 
proven human health risk and should not be 
banned on existing evidence. 

The report released yesterday by the 
American Council on Science and Health 
(ACSH) is notably less cautious than a similar 
one last November by the presitigious National 
Academy of Sciences, even though both studies 
examined the same data . 

The academy concluded that the artificial 
sweetener was a low-potency cancer-causing 
agent in animals and also appeared to promote 
the cancer-causing activity of other substances. 

Although there is no proven human risk, the 
academy said, saccharin " must be viewed as a 
potential cause of cancer in humans." 

The council's interpretation is that since there 
is no proven human risk, saccharin should be 
considered safe. 

"Saccharin poses no known hazard to human 
health and should not be banned," said Dr. 
Elizabeth M. Whelan , the council's executive 

The Food and Drug Administration ought to 
ban saccharin in the spring of 1977 when studies 
showed it caused bl adder cancer in male rats at 
high dosages. The agency cited the o-called 
"Delaney clause" of a law passed in 1958 that 
requires banning any food additive found to 
cause cancer in animals or men. 

Because of a public outcry over the 
prospective banning of the last general-purpose 
artificial sweetener on the market, Congress 
stepped in and declared an 18-month 
moritorium pending further study. That 
moritorium expires May 23, and the FDA has 
indicated it will go ahead with the proposed ban 
unless Congress intervenes again. 

The council is a non-profit, privately-funded 
group that says it accepts no support from 
special interests involved in areas it studies, 
including the food industry. The group of 45 
scientists was formed last year and offers a 
more conservative view than many so-called 
public interest organizations. 

INTERNATIONAL 
Begin Will Visit White House Tomorrow 

WASHINGTON (AP) - PresidentCartersaid 
yesterday that Israeli Prime Minister 
Menachem Begin has decided to come here for 
" a frank discussion of all the issues" in the 
stalled peace treaty talks. 

The announcementCollowed Begin's refusal to 
attend a Camp David summit with Carter and 
Khalil. The Israeli Cabinet turned down that 
invitation on a 14-2 vote . 

Carter told a news conference that after he 
sees Begin, who is due here Thursday evening, 
he will consider asking Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat or Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil 
here as well. 

Carter said he talked by telephone after the 
Cabinet action with both Begin and Sadat. He 
stressed the importance of completing a treaty 
and that he hoped his talks with Begin would 
lead to an early resumption of negotiations.

OASIS Offers More Than Tutoring 
By Vielya Tolani 

Staff Writer 
OASIS is an academic 

support program in the 
broadest sense, according to 
Dr. Kenneth Majer, directoroC 
OASIS, the O((ice or Academic 
Support and Instructional 

Multiple Choice Tests Computer-Checked for Value; 
Reading, Writing and Stress Reduction Skills Taught 

Program (ASP) mainly 
directed toward Educational 
Opportunity Program (EOP) 
students also provides services 
Cor other students in need of 
academic counseling. 

, Service. "We provide services 
to students and also work with 
raculty and staCr." 

The most popular or OASIS' 
programs is the tutoring 
service. However, in addition to 
tutoring, they provide many 
other forms or academic aid, 
including their academic, 
reading and study skills 
programs , writing adjunct 
classes , instructional media 
development and a re earch 
and evaluation program Cor 
faculty members. 

The latter program provides 
Caculty with a computer 
evaluation and analysis of their 
multiple choice tests. The 

results o( the tests are Ced into 
the computer which then 
analyzes the value of the test. 
The program can also be used 
Cor other educational purposes. 

"This is the most critical of 
our programs because it 
constantly oversees that we are 
accountable for the fund s 
that we receive," said Majer. 
" It is a (acuity service as well 
as an internal monitoring 
program." 

Another Caculty service at 
OASIS is the Instructional 
Materials Development 
Program. 

Jeffrey Glenn-Levin, pro-
gram coordinator, assists 
teachers by making tapes that 
are related to the course 

material. Levin explained that 
the tapes have been used to 
" demonstrate lab experiments 
and cover course topics, 
thereby removing the student 
from the lecture. " 

He added that the tapes are a 
self-instruction" Cor students to 
review and learn materials by 
themselves. " 

Also included in OASIS 
programs are writing classes. 
There are basically three such 
classes: the writing adjunct 
cia s , which is designed Cor 
freshmen enrolled in required 
writing classes, the Revelle 
Assignment Brainstorm, 
designed for Revelle students 
in the Humanities 10 and II 
cour es, and classes which help 

upper division students with 
research writing and term 
papers. 

"We do not write students' 
papers and we do not edit or 
prooCread them," sa id Dr. John 
Waterhouse, writing clinic 
coordinator. " We explore the 
assignment Cor the students 
and talk about the ways to 
approach it." 

OASIS also provides classes 
Cor reading skills. The crc..sses 
focus upon basic ski lls, "power 
reading" (cri tical and 
analytical reading) and speed 
reading. 

Study skills seminars are 
held weekly which deaJ with a 
diHerent skill each session. 

The Academic Skills 

Program coordinator Phyllis 
Elame said that the ASP's 
primary goal is to "coordinate 
support for EOP students" and 
to "personally make them 
aware of all the academic 
services that are provided ." 

In addition to academic 
counseling. the ASP also 
conducts special academic 
skills semi nar s when in 
demand . They offer time 
management, stress reduction, 
and skills counseling work-

Women Swimmers Best 9 School Records 
By Jon Cooelz 

Smlor Staff Writer 
Swimming against past and 

future Olympians. the UCSD 
women only rared 13th or the 15 
teams· competing at last 
weekend's Stanrord InvIta-
tional. 

Their low finish tells little of 
the personal story though. Six 
swimmers went on a record 
breaking rampage, setting nine 
new school marks ultogether in 
the team 's 1978-79 season 
finale. 

Chris Evuns came back with 
six new records herself. She 
·bettered her old 200 individual 
medley time, swam the fastesl 

400 1M. and ' broke Nadine 
Thompson's 200 b:lckstl'oke 
l'Ceord. Additionally , s he led off 
the reeol'd breaking 200 :,md 400 
medley l'el:lYs with backstroke 
legs in the races , and swam in 
the fustest 200 frec relay in 
school history. 

The 400 medley relay time of 
4: 32 .4 by Evans , Janet 
Parkinson. Shawn Blaisdell, 
and Claudia O'Brien mashed 
their old time of 4: 48.0 by 
nearly 16 seconds . The same 
four set the 200 m'edley relay 
record,

finals. She was only a second 
away from qualifying for the 
national meet. also. Her 1: 13 
100 breaststroke time beat her 
old school mark, while Kuaren 
Rekken and Kathy Conklin both 
dropped several seconds off 
their previous times in that 
event. 

Blaisdell, who recently won 
"Athlefe of the Month" honol·s. 
set a new record with her I: 05.5 

100 fly finish . She al 0 swam to 
her personal be t in the 100 1M. 

Even the I-ecord setting 
UCSD swims, however. failed 
to make a dent on UCLA. USC,

schools at the competition. 

'-The meet wus above our 
head, " said Coach Diana Dann. 
" But at least we beal two 
schools. Some girl were 
complaining about being 
bUl'ned out by the end of the

Softball.Team Seen Strong Despite Youth 
By Cindy Biondi 

Putting out a strong effort to 
overcome problems of a late 
sta rt a nd lack of veteran 
players on the team, the 
Women's Softball squad is still 
hopeful of fielding a strong 

team. Most of the new players 
have had some experience, 
a lthough not intercollegiately. 
Elliott felt that at Saturday's 
practice the team was really 
beginning to pull together a nd 
should be prepared (or a good

this Thursday , March I , 
against SDSU, 

The coach singled out Liz 
Grossman and Lynn Paul as 
strong infielders, Tracey 
Weisenheimer will be backing 
up the infield in the center field 
position. Weisenheimer's good 
speed and excellent motor 
skills should keep the outfield 
under control. Paula Weddle, 
the . catche~, is credited by 

"We'l~ give it a good shot," 
says fir~t year coach John 
Elliott of the opening game. 
Elliott has confidence in the 
team's defensive strength and 
improved batting skills. 

There are no returning

Hud Freeze, UCSD Bio Grad Shocked of Golden Opportunity ... 
By Lynette Tom 
Senior slarr Wriler 

Many would consider the 
dates of February 15 and 22 as 
having little or no historical 
value. Not so for a particular 
School of Medicine post-
doctorate and aspiring actor by 
the name of Hud Freeze. To the 
28 year old , these two 
Thursdays will hold a lasting 
significance as the days he 
acqui red the respective titles of 
locul and na tional winner of 
Paramount's talent search . 

"I was really shocked," he 
declared. "I thought I ha d a 
pretty good shot at the local 
finals, but never anywhere 
close to the nationals." 

The subject of acting could 
have not been rurther away 
not have been further away 
years ago. At that time, he was 
an Indiana University graduate 
with a B .S. in microbiology . He 
came to UCSD in 1970 where, as 
Freeze recalled, " 1 wa a 
model graduate st'udent and a 
scientific nurd, " and received 
his M.S. in biology a yea a ter. 
The studies, strains, a~d 
stresses that are synonymous 
with graduate school finally 
took its toll upon him in 1973 as a 
result of a discouraging biology 
thesis . 

"I wanted to explore a 

different part of me," he 
confessed . "Acting came out of 
the frustration of science not 
going well ." 

While a udienc es were 
marvelling over Freeze's 
appearances on the local stage, 
Paramount was equally raving 
over the screen performance of 
Eric Roberts in King of the 
Gypsies. Hoping to repe<lt its 
good fortune . the studio 
establi hed a talent search in 21 
m ajor cities throughout the 
United States. Talent scouts 
were selected in each city, to 
whom aspiri ng actors and 
actresses sol ici ted an 8xl0 
black and white photograph of 
themselves, a short resume. 
and a written expl<lnation of 
why they thought they were 
ready for sturdom. 

In San Diego, the honor fell 
upon KGTY reporter Gl'eg 
Dumas . Allhough membership 
in a n actor's union was not 
necessary, the entries must be 
experienced and from the San 
Di ego Co unty area . A 
committee of fi ve , comprised of 
Dumas a nd rour local experts in 

- the motion pi cture field, wa set 
up. The group carefully went 
over the 250 submissions that 
arrived in the mail and chose 41 
for interviews. or the 41. six 
£ina lists were selected and 

from tho e six, the local winner 
was decided on what Dumas 
termed "a vote for three 
process." 

Freeze heard of the t<llent 
search through word of mouth. 
On the day before the contest's 
deadline, he submitted hi s 
material to the committee. 
Despite his near miss and the 
fac t that , .. IS Dumas remarked, 
" he had tough competition with 
very strong people," Freeze 
won the title unanimously . 

"There a re certai n people 
who walk inside and im-
medi<ltely light up the room ," 
continued Duma . "If these 
persons ha ve ta lent, it comes 
through as a supplement. Hud 
Freeze is one oftflOse persons ... 

As a loca l winner, Freeze 
received a cash award of $500 
and a consideration for the 
national finals . All materials . 
along with videotaped 
covereage of Freeze and 
Dum<ls, were sent to the 
Parumounl Corpor<.ltion in New 
York . Of the 21 individuals who 
won locally in their cities, five 
finali sts were selected from 
Denver. Okl<.lhom<.l City, S<.ln 
Diego, Washington , D.C .. and 
<l nother city. Freeze's c h<.l nces 
of ta king the top honor became 
a reality l"lst week. 

" I'm very huppy that we

were able to have someone 
from San Diego win th e 
national finals." said Dumas. 
"It's a vicarious joy for me." 

" It h<ls brought out a lot of 
genuineness in people." stuted 
Freeze. " This is omething that 
they can get really excited 
about. People have been very 
courteous. They're .pulling for 
me and that's a good feeling ." 

As a na tiona l winner, Freeze 
recei·ves a sc ree nte s t at 
Paramount to be held Lhis 
week, and the studio is not 
alone. Courtesy of the William 
Morris agency , the actor has 
gone to CBS's MTM Produc-
tions , ABC television, Lorimar 
Studios , a nd Universal 
Pictures for auditions and 
interviews. The above, along 
with considerations for a pilot 
entitled Op rating Room and 
the television series Eight I 
Enough. has occurred within a 
surprisingly short span or a 
week and a half . Freeze 
assesses his c hances of a 
profes ional acting career as 
bright, but not definite . 

"It's like a knock on the door. 
When that knock come , you 
cun 't suy no to it. But, it doesn 't 
mean a thing unless you have a 
contract und Hre p rforming on 
the l:Jge. I take everything as

Art~ 
UtSD, SDSU Cooperating in Arts 

By.Kathryn Callahan 
UCSD and SDSU graduate 

students are currently 
exhibiting their works at the 
Community Arts Gallery. 

Upon entering the gallery, 
the viewer is drawn by the 
glimmering color and textures 
of Le lie Vemouf-Garcia's 
Apaches & Santa Fe, a 
monumental- ized canvas . The 
metallic aluminum of her 
locomotive and the gold spray 
paint intermittently applied to 
depict the radiating heat of the 
sand complement one another. 
The vivid t xture of the Indians 
themselves is enhanced by the 
discreet collage of woven braid 
worked into the ceremonial 
Apa che rega li a. There is 
dynami c movement in the 
speeding train which seems to 
be not only encircling the 
rhythmic dancers , but 
potentially consuming them , so 
that the work becomes a 
statement on the absorption 
and obliteration of the 
American Indian culture by 
American " progress." 

Elizabeth Guheen also uses 
monumental-sized canvases to 
deal with concepts of 

·· progress ." Her Land 
Development I and II present 
two examples of what could be 
a contractor's rough plur1s for a 
new hou ing community or an 
artist's aesthetic appreciation 
of spacial rclLltionship . 
However. the sombre chalk

bloody red f1<.1g of <.I dynamite

assa sin ' target in Develop-
ment I. Thus the work conveys 
pathos for the <.Ibu e of virgin

Bill Grigsby 's work echos the 
theme of the rape of the 
environment with his snapshot-
like paintings of tract homes 
entitled, Locusts on the Land 
and The Facade. The latter 
exhibits a faSCinating texture 
achieved by underpainting. 

James Randall chooses to 
deal with the wastes of our '

UFO Helps Solve Energy Crisis 
By Judi Blocker 

Strangers in the Night, new 
from UFO, is not your typical 
double live album. Recorded in 
Chicago on their last tour, the 
energy genera ted by the 
audience is present, yet you 
don 't hea r endless clapping and 
screaming competing with the 
music. 

'Strangers in the Night' is High Rock 
Music Without Blandness of Queen, Boston 

The a rra ngements of their 
m a teria l, a ll from previous 
a lbums, while origina l, tends 
not to s tray muc h from the 
polished s tudio versions. Those 
unfamilia r with UFO will be 
surprised by how refined ha rd 
meta l roc k can sound without 
the sophistication necessa ry in 
such groups as Queen a!ld 

Boston . Michael Schenker 's 
awesome guitar playing is 
accented by Phil Mogg's strong 
vocals, and melodic keyboards 
a nd synthesizers playing by ex-
Savoy Brown Paul R aymond 
tha t at times ound like a violin 
section of an orchestra. 

Some songs on the album are 
intended for pure phys ical 
pleasures. " Doctor, Doctor," 
" Let it Roll ," and " Only You

and " Love to Love ." These are 
rock ballads that play on 
sentiment but still stay within 
the ra wness of the hard rock 
song. 

The peak of the concert 
album begins with side 3 and 
" Lights Out. " This song sounds 
like an inva sion of low audio 
frequencies that even vibrate 
hag carpeting. Put this on in 

the morning and forget about 
coffee. But this is nothing after 
the double dose delivered in 
" Rock Bottom." It makes Led 
Zeppelin ound Ii ke easy 

listening (this analogy for 
impact only). In "Rock 
Bottom " Schenker plays a 
guitar solo that captures the 
ear in the same profound 
manner as classical pianist. He 
moves through drastic changes 
and fluid runs to notes that skip 
across the strings. Each is 
clean and on the dot. After the 
solo is over the song returns and 
hits like an encore . 

What seems strange is the 
order of the songs. There is still 
a side 4 that doesn 't continue 
this performance. It's like

OASIS 
Aid 

(Continued from page 4) 
basement of the Humanities 
Library, the tutorial services 
provide tutoring in lower 
division math, chemistry, 
physics, biology , economics, 
political science, psychology , 
Latin and music. 

Until two years ago, the only 
tutorial services ava ilable 
were in math and science. 

Beryl Brown, coordinator of 
the tutorial program, said she 
is "in charge of the respon-
sibility of providing any kind of 
support necessary to help 
students survive (academ-
ical)y) in the University." 

To. obtain a tutor, students 
should drop by OASIS during 
office' hours. The Underground 
is open 53 hours a week and has 
115 tutors. 

The tutors are either enrolled 
in or have completed a four-unit ' 
course in Teacher Education 
Program (TEP 196). 

" Training our tutors for 
credit is a great strength, " said 
Majer. He noted that many 
learning centers at other 
universities do not train their 
tutors,

R Expert Attacks Chavez Strategy 
(Continued r 
farmers' ~i es and relatives, 
and high school tudents to cut 
his lettuce, which had begun to 
rot in the fidd . 

Saikhort also hired security 
guards at $38,000 per week and 
brought in a high-powered 
public relations man, conser-
vative media wizard ' Bill 
Roberts, to "take the growers ' 
message to the nation." 

The importance of public 
relations was a les on growers 
learned the hard way during 

previous baltles with lhe UFW. 
Seventeen million Ameri<: .. ms 
boycotted lettuce and grape - in 
response to Chuvez's appeals in 
the early 1970s. 

Chavez ha sa id that he would 
personally spearhead lhe 
revivul of urbun suppoltgroup 
which were disbanded a year 
ago, and may resume a 
consumer boycott again t the 
lettuce grower . . 

Roberts ' job is to head off lhe 
possibility of a boycott. In the 
past, he ha repre ented uch 

clients as Honald Heagan, 
Nelson Rockefeller and Gerald 
Ford. This year, he eXI)Ccts to 
exploit u conservative s\\ing in 
the country by raising the high 
cost of food as an issue in the 
strike . 

" esar's only p"lt argument 
is thal he 's fighting for the poor 
and the downtrodden, " Roberts 
says . " That sold well 10 ycars 
ago, but I maintain that isn' t 
the case in the Iml>CI'ial Valley, 
and it no longer sells like he 
thinks it sells." 

Hoberls' firm has placed full

Glider Pilot Dies 
First AII'-Campus Yearbook 

A hung glider pilot was killed 
yesterdl.lY l.Il'ternoon when his 
gl ieter dove back into the 
Torrey Pines Cliff immediately 
aCter takeoff from the glider 
pOI't there. 

The name of the pilot is being 
withheld pending notification oC 
next or kin . 

According to other pilots on 
the scene, the man' killed 
yesterday hud been flying in 
the Torrey Pines ar a Cor 
l.Ipproximately two year . Includes' 26% 'of Seniors The accident wa apparently caused by the pilot's failure to 

insert a saCety pin on his cral't, 
according to' other glider pilots 
present at the time oC the 
accident. 

This is the tenth hang glider 
related death reported in San 
Diego County , a<:col'ding to the 
County Coronel"s orCice. 

By Vidya Tolani 
Staff Writer 

Twenty-six percent of the 
senior cla s were photographed' 
this month for UCSD's first all-
campus yearbook, according to 
Yolanda Garcia , Revelle 
student activities coordinator. 

Garcia explained that until 
last year , Revelle was the only 
college with a yearbook. "It 
was. Revelle's idea to have a 
yearbook," she said, "but 1 felt 
that it w{)uld be more 
meaningful to include every-
one. " She added that she 
thought that it would be a better 
yearbook with the other 
colleges. 

Last Sept. Garcia ent a 
letter to eaeh of the deans of the 
c!lll~ges , _ prop~ ing that the 

yearbook include the entire 
campus. This uggeslion wa 
approved in Oct. by the deans 
and the college councils. 'The 
yearbook will be called " UCSD 
'79," and will be olely funded 
by its sales. Garcia reported 
that 511 seniors were 
photographed , and 75 % 
ordered a yeC:lrbook copy, 
which will eost $6.45. "I am not 
disappointed in the results ," 
she said , although she 
acknowledged that the low 
percentage . could indicate a 
lack of interest on the students' 

, part. 
" I think that next year there 

should be more turnouts," she 
added. • 'There was ufficient 
publicity, but it takes years for 
seniors to go for this soIl of

The yearbook, which will be 
available on June 8, will be 
approximately 62 pages in 
length . " There will be 36 page 
of introduction and 4 pages of 
campu -wide pictures. The re t 
oC th yearbook will have senior 
pictures and enior quotes . 

Its length is substantially les 
than UCLA's "Southern 
Campu ," which is 300 pages, 
and Berkeley 's "Blue and 
Gold, " which is 240 pages. 
However , the " Southern

North City West, 
(Continued from page 1) 

Area school district , in 
particular, fear that school-age 
children will . be placed in their 
schools and cause an over-
crowding problem if school 
racilitie are not built in the 
initial development phase of 
North City West. School di trict 
representatives will have u 
ch<'lDce to present the 'e fear at 
l.I Transportation and Land 
Development hearing today . 

Mitchell stressed that he will 
not upport the development if 

schools are not immediutely 
available Cor North City West 
residents. 

He said that the Council will 
not make a final vote on N.o~h 

ily West until at leastlhe end 
of March. 

Yesterday P (Irks indicated 
dissatisfaction with the 
Councirs vote. 

" Now we ve gOl a growth 
machine built on growth, " she 
commented, " und we 've got to 
keep on feeding the machine."
