Athletics funding cut 
$200,000 for 2003-'04 
By CLAYTON WORFOLK 

Senior Staff Writer 

In respon e to recent Cuts in ath-
letics funding at UCSD, the A.S. 
Council unanimously endorsed a 
resolution on March 5 calling upon 
administration to make athletics a 
higher budget priOrity. 

The athletics department and 
other UC D student ervlces are 
facing a $200,000 reduction In 
funds as a re ult of Gov. Gray 
Davis ' January proposal for the 
2003-04 budget. Davi ' proposal 
slashed $25.3 million in student 
services funding from the 
University of California's budget. 

The Office of Student Affair 
allocated the student service cut-
backs at UC D, reducll1g funding 
for particular program and er-
vices by various degrees. The cut to 
athletics represents about 20 per-
cent of its initial regi tration fee 

funding allocation, one of the 
largest cutbacks Imposed by the 
OS A, accordll1g to Director of 
Athletics Earl \V Edwards. 

The Resolution In uppon of 
Intercollegiate Athletics and 
Intercollegiate Athletics Fundll1g, 
submitted by A. . Commissioner of 
Athletics RoblO helton, states that 
"budget cuts placed upon the 
Intercollegiate thlencs 
Department were unfair and IOcon-
istent With student opiruons." The 

resolution malOt31ns that athJetics 
encourage campu spint, Ul1lty and 
pride _ aims that sntdents have his-
torically supp neu.

dation made thiS year by the

Humans affect size of 
marine snails and limpets 

Due to collection by humans. the average 
size of marine snails and limpets alon6 the 
Southem Califomia coast has declined Signif-
icantly over the past century. according to a 
study conducted by UCSD biologists. 

The new information sheds light on an 
ecological problem linked to human popula-
tion growth on the coast. wlhich has led to a 
stnking decrease in the sizes of many marine 
invertebrate species in coastal habitats. 

Researchers compared museum collec-
tions of shells with field samples of four 
species of gastropods along 120 miles of 
Southem Califomia coastline. Of the four 
species. only the owl limpet was extensively 
collected by humans as a food item. 
However. the researchers found that the 
average body sizes of all four species 
declined si~nificantly over time. 

The study was conducted by Kaustuv Roy. 
Allen Collins. Bonnie Seder. Emina Begovic 
and John En~. The results of the study are 
published in the March issue of Ecology Letters.

represent the malOllty vote of the ed,tonal board and are not necessar· 
ily those of the UC Board of Regents, the ASUCSD 01 the members of 

the Guardion staff. 

Dynes merits 
applause for 

supporting labor 
Last week, the C Board of Regent fin-

ished its first official visit to UCSD ince 
1999. During their stay, the Regents were 
treated to everal pre entation about the 
current situation on campus and the future 
of C D. During one of the presentations, 
Chancellor Robert C. Dyne said that 

C D is "on track for being a model in ti-
tution of the 21 t century." Thi is nice, bur 
it wa a later comment by Dynes that i mo t 
noteworthy. In reference to the ongoing UC 
labor di putes, Dynes told the UC Regents 
how important those workers are to the 
campus and that he could not do his job 
without that staff. 

In light of the prote ts and bad blood 
between the UCSD administration and 
the workers, who have said that UCSD is a 
bad employer on several occasions, it was a 
great gesture for Dynes to go to bat for the 
faculty and staff on campus, recognizing 
just how much they do and how integral 
they are to the everyday operation of 
UCSD. Often, the jobs of the staff get 
overlooked. These are people that not 
only teach our classes, but also serve us 
food and keep our classroom and study 
areas clean and safe. The e may not be the 
most glamorous of jobs, but that does not 
make them any less important to the 
everyday operations of UCSD. 

This was not something that Dynes had 
to do. However, the fact that he made it an 
issue during a visit from some of the most 
powerful people in the University of 
California really showed that he is willing to 
stick up for the faculty and staff. 

It is also worth noting that Student 
Regent Dexter Ligot-Gordon applauded 
Dynes for his comments supporting the fac-
ulty and staff at UCSD. He even took it a 
step further and said, "The [labor] problems 
are not really his fault; they are really the 
Regents' fault." This showed that Dynes' 
comments did have an effect and will hope-
fully open the Regents' eyes about the labor 
situation so that there can be a swift and fair 
resolution to the disputes. 

PROPS & FLOPS 

tlIF I GO DOWN, HE GOES DOWN." 
Kennck Leung/Guard"", 

Spanos goes too far in enacting clause 
Chargers once again threaten move to other city 

By JOSH CROUSE 
Senior Staff Writer 

Say what you will about the San 
Diego Chargers' desire for a new foot-
ball stadIUm, but the way that the team 
is going about getting that stadium is 
downright disgusting. 

On March 4, Chargers President 
Dean Spanos sent a letter to the San 
Diego City Council announcing the 
team's enactment of a trigger clause 
that would allow the team to negotiate 
with other cities . While Spanos 
announced that the activation of the 
clause is part of an agreed-upon 
process of negotiation through a full-
page ad in the March 5 San Ditgo 
Unum- Tnbunt, the timing of the activa-
tion says otherwise. 

The announcement came just two 
days before a city council-appointed 
usk force on a new football stadium in 
San Diego was to present its findings to 
the council. Though the task force's 
report has not been made public, it is 
believed that it was going to recom-
mend that the Chargers pay 100 per-
cent of the construction costs for any 
new stadIum that would be built. The 
Chargers had previously proposed 
splitting the costs With the CIty, and the 
timing of the clause's activation speaks 
volumes toward the team's Intentions. 
Instead of waiting for the usk force's 
report, the team tried to take the spot-
light with a very public threat of a 
move, to downplay the weight of the 
task force's findings and convince San 
Diegans that they should empty their 
pockets before the leam leaves town. 

San Diego has long been threatened 
that If it doesn't fork over a new stadi-
um, the Chargers will pack up shop and 
move to Los Angeles. Though many 
thought - or feebly hoped - that it 
was only an idle threat, that threat 
became startlingly closer to reality with 
the activation of the trigger clause. 

, 

NATIONAL 

" NetJemUnd that [Qualcomm 
Stadium] has hosted two 

recent Super Bowls and was 
substantially overhauled arui 
improved within the last 10 

years. " 
The 1995 lease that the Chargers 

signed with San Diego for Qualcomm 
Stadium stipulated that the team could 
reopen negotiations once every four 
years. By doing the math, one would 
see that we are in a negotiation-eligible 
year. The clause gives the city three 
months of exclusivity to negotiate a 
new lease with the Chargers. However, 
during that time, the Chargers are free 
to talk to other cities, but negotiations 
are not allowed. Should no lease be 
signed by that time, the tum then has 
six months to negotiate with other 

cmes. Should another city make the 
Chargers an offer (can you say "Los 
Angeles"?), San Diego then ha 90 days 
to match the deal. 

Though in his ad, Spanos promised 
that he is committed to San Diego and 
would not speak to other cities, he did 
not include such a guarantee in the for-
mal notice to the city of San Diego that 
the trigger clause was being activated. 
Basically, Spanos wanted to try to put a 
good public pin on the clause by 
attempting to reassure fans of the 
team's loyalty to the city, while at the 
same time keeping his options open. 

Spanos' handling of the enare stadi-
um sItuation has been less than honor-
able. With the NFL under a lot of 
pressure to fill the nation's largest mar-
ket (Los Angeles), the team moved it 
training camp from the friendly con-
fines of UCSD to a facility in Los 
Angeles. Many took this as a public 
threat that the team would move north 
for good - and rightly so. Spanos has 
been jealous ever since the Padres got a 
beautiful new stadium in downtown 
San Diego. He claims that the more-
than-30-year-old Qualcomm Stadium 
is vastly outdated and not up to the 
team's standards. evermind that the 
stadi um has hosted two recent Super 
Bowls and was substantially overhauled 
and improved within the last 10 years. 

Tne next step came at this years 
Super Bowl when NFL Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue announced that an 
Diego would not gel another Super 
Bowl unless it built a new stadllllll . 
This prompted announcer John 
Madden to publicly question 
Tagliabue'S sanity during the Super 
Bowl broadcast. 

Granted, the current stadIUm in 
Murphy Canyon needs some updates. 
It could definitely do with a facelift, 
especially after the Padres leave and the

USSA diversity guide 
misrepresents UCSD 

Conference attendees do not 
reflect school's makeup 

By JESSICA LlNGEL 
Associate Opinion Editor 

The Associated Students at 
UCSD recently won a free registra-
tion waiver worth $170 to a nation-
al conference in Washington, D.C. 
As a result, a delegation of UCSD 
students will be anending the 
United tates tudent Association-
hosted ational Grassroots 
Legislative Conference in 
Washington, D.C.. to discuss cur-
rent legislative issues ' concerning 
education. 

But instead of compiling a 
group of indIviduals that accurately 
represents the demographic and 
racial background of UCSD, the 
USAA guidelines have set specific 
standards for the envoy, require-
ments that cater much more to the 
ideal parameters of what consti-
nltes diversity rather than the ideal 
candidates qualified to generate 
discussion. 

There are specific rules as to 
whom the A.S. Council will send to 
cash in on the waiver. UCSD's 
population falls in between the 
20,501- and 30,500-srudent cate-
gory, which, according to the 
USSA guidelines, means that they 
strongly sugge t delegation should 
con ist of 10 people - four 
women, one of whom is of color; 
two persons of color; one "queer of 
color;" and one student who is 
either not of a typical college age, 
di abled, a veteran or internation-
al. 

CSD's student body isn't 40 
percent women, it's much more like 
50 percent. The school isn't 10 I)cr-
cent gay and of color. (the rampant 
hom phobia on campus prevents 
an accurate number from being 
available) and neither is it 10 per-
cent di abled, international or vet-
eran . 

This isn't to say that the group 
sent to repre ent UCSD should be 
directly proportional to race or 
gender tatistics, although that 
would be more logical than con-
forming to some abstract asser-
tion made regarding what would 
form the most politically correct 
collection of individuals . 
Doubtless, the best delegation 
would be formed of srudents who 
were the most informed about 

legislative issues concerning edu-
cation. 

There shouldn't be background 
quotas on representatives for a 
delegation intended to speak for 
an entire srudent body. Enforcing 
standards of heritage, race, sexual 
orientation, gender or otherwise 
does not ensure that those repre-
sentatives will be necessarily qual-
ified to partiCIpate in the D.C. 
forum. This is neither an argu-
ment for or against affirmative 
action, nor is it an accusation of 
racial profiling. Rather, it is the 
simple observation that creating 
quotas In order to ensure diversity 
is completely counterproductive in 
an attempt to represent a given 
group. 

The purpose of the US SA con-
ference is not to gather a collection 
of diverse individuals, but rather to 
learn about how to improve educa-
tion at the university level. 
Certainly, minority rights and 
issues should be discussed, and the 
people most apt to discuss them 
would probably be minorities. But 
the people most apt to contribute 
to a debate on legislative change 
should not be expected to adhere 
to standards that have nothing to 
do with their ambition to invoke 
change. 

It would be great if the group 
that traveled to the USSA confer-
ence were diverse and varied. It 
would be wonderful if they 
spanned a number of demograph-
ic categories and repre en ted dif-
ferent classes, races, backgrounds 
and ideologies. But those should 
be secondary considerations at 
most. 

Instead of using race and gen-
der as primary requirements, the 
USSA should ask for students who 
stand to gain the most from the 
trip. It hould be a group that 
most accurately represents its stu-
dent body. And more than any-
thing else, it should consist of sru-
dents who are capable of creating 
change. Demanding that the A.S. 
Council provide a certain number 
of characteristics in it make-up 
docs nothing to create change; it 
only generates a false image of its 
campus and inhibits an honest dis-
cussion of how to make thing 
better.

Though often rough, UCSD is an idyll 
Profound statements provoke contemplation

mouth 

EdWu 
Anything is a legitimatt area of 

invtstiglltion. 
Crammed against a pillar in the 

Price Center on a rainy day, it 
becomes all tOo obvious that 
despite what may be said about 
expansions, fee increases, railroad-
ing, an evil vice chancellor and 
politics, the place is altogether too 
crowded. ow, while a rainy day 
in San Diego is no doubt a chance 
occurrence, eating my food stand-
ing up mashed in between waves 
of people is no doubt ome SOrt of 
metaphor for life as an undergrad-
uate on this campus. And then 
again, for all the griping I do in 
this column and the reams of 
newsprint I waste complaining 
about random academic policies 
(or nonexistent expansions), once 
in a while, one has to look back 
and realize just how petty and idi-
otic it seems in comparison to 
global events - or even the suf-
fering of individuals not privy to 
the ivory tower we live in. 

MlIrdtr has its mcwl sidt. 
Not to be melodramatic or 

anything, but our society is about 
to embark on a mission to kill 
potentially thousands of people we 
have deemed a threat to us. Now, 
regardless of one's politics, I do 
wonder if the intractable differ-
ence between tho e who oppose 
war and those who favor it is the 
question of whether it is a greater 
sin to kill one's enemy who might 
- and might not - kill one's kin, 
or to let one's kin be slain by inac-
tion . One wonders JUSt how much 
either side, pacifist or hawk, 
allows that the issue is a bit less 
than black and white. 

In II dream you found a way to 
live and you wert fillrd WIth joy. 

But then maybe geopolitics is 
all rather silly as well. Wars and 
diplomacy, rhetoric upon idiocy; 
we live relatively peaceful lives in 
our enclave, and we need not be 
disrurbed by the events of the out-
side world. Maybe the melodra-
matic thing is to march and chant 
and believe I'm acrually going to 
change the cour e of anything by 
carrying a sign in an Francisco or 
writing a column. tn all reality, 
I'm halfway convinced that 

UCSD is some second coming of 
Eden, between the weather, the 
utter lack of violent crime and the 
plenty of fruit to be had. There's 
even a plaque about the tree of 
knowledge in John Muir College 
somewhere. If we went to war, the 
campus population would likely 
be so apathetic that few would 
bother to protest; as it is, hardly 
anybody here is politically active. 
Maybe, despite my derision of this 
campus's apathy in the past, it's 
just contentedness with the starus 
quo. I mean, in an ideal world, 
would politics even exist? 
Though, one does wonder how we 
could banish debates on election 
bylaws and slates and constitu-
tionality from our paradise. 

Grass roots organrzation IS tht 
only hope. 

And yet, when I'm on campus 
and I look around, I get the 
inevitable feeling there's some-
thing wrong with the setting. It is 

" In an ideal world, would 
poUrics even exist? 

Though , one does won~ 
der how we could banish 

debates on election 
bylaws and slates and 
constitutionality from 

our parcu1i.se.)) 
as if you've gone to a play and 
they've cast a rather sickly glow of 
green-yellow on what would oth-
erwise be a beautiful backdrop. 
Maybe it's the buildings; the only 
architccrural theme on campus, no 
doubt, is prefabricated chao. The 
problem is neIther the fact that It 
is ugly nor that it is disquieting. 
The problem is that a campus in 
transition constantly looks that 
way; the buildings elicit a ense 
that everything is temporary and 
the campus has all the charm of a 
'90s office block out in Mira Mesa. 
The very architecture I learn in 
reminds me constantly of my 
ephemeral time at the university. 
It·s so seeped into my bones that 
despite the fact I live in paradi e, 
I'm suppo ed to get booted. Like 
the way the buildings look, I'm a 
temporary firture - and the 

problem is that so is every other 
undergraduate here. The only 
whispers of the past can be found 
etched into some concrete in 
Revelle Plaza. 

LOlllng ammals Ir a mbstif1lft 
adivity. 

The Sruart Collection of art on 
campus eems to try to rectify all 
that with perfectly placed reposi-
tories of culrure scattered across 
campus. It's as i( we can make up 
for lack of history, architectural 
style and substance by cramming 
as much culture as we can into 
these pieces and letting them radi-
ate out from opporrune locations 
- let everyone walk under gIraffe 
nets to get to class. The sliding 
doors to the library that every-
body uses is art. Your culture, your 
uniqueness, is placed in well-posi-
tioned places so that you're stuffed 
chock full of it when you walk by, 
and the campus does not have to 
cater to you for the rest. J cnny 
Holzer, to whom all the ayings in 
this article are attributed to, illus-
trates this beautifully with her 
"Green Table" si lting in Muir. 
Hundreds of random, profound 
statements are embedded OntO 
this huge table; it's as if the very 
act of passing by it and reading a 
few will enlighten you. 

Purromg plfamrr for Ihe rake of 
pltQsurt will rom you. 

And then if you read enough of 
the "truisms" embedded Into the 
table, you realize what the joke is: 
They're not profound. They're 
pseudo-profound and often con-
tradictOry. And yet it still all 
appeals to you because you can 
grab nuggets - the ones that suit 
you best (as I've done with my col-
umn hcre) - and quote them to 
yourself and think that there's 
something worthy in them. 
Maybe, then, it's quite silly to be 
melodramatic about the state of 
this school, Its architecture and 
many of the man itles of life here at 
UCSD. Maybe the lesson is to 
take those pseudo-profound real-
iutlons, tell yourself to Ignore the 
rest, and realize that what's 
"important" has little to nothing, 
or everything, to do WIth our lives 
here at UCSD, or the columns I 
write. 

This column stands for egalitanan 
principles. As a resull all correspon-
dence sent to e2wu@ucsdedu will 
be treated WIth the same amount of

Chargers: 
Qualcomm 

not that

continued from page 4 
stadium is relegated to a purely 
football venue. However, since the 
stadium has hosted two Super 
Bowls since 1998, it is clearly not 
the outdated monstrosity that 
Spanos and Tagliabue would like 
people to believe. It is sti ll a fu lly 
fu nctional stadium that many 
regard as one of the best in the 
league. 

Even if one were inclined to 
agree that the Chargers need a new 
stadium, this is not the way to go 
about getting one. The honorable 
and decent thing for Spanos to do 
would have been to can the threats, 
wait for the task force's proposal 
and then work with the city on the 
possibility of a new stadium. 
Making public threats and under-
mining important reports wilh ill-
timed activation of clauses only 
alienates fans and makes the team 
10 e credibility with the communi-
ty. 

In an era when profes ional 
sports is gening an increasingly bad 
name, it is a shame to see a profes-
sional franchise act in sllch an irre-
sponsible manner. Were panos a 
dedicated to the city a he claimed 
to be in his advertisement, he 
would have included in his letter to 
the city the guarantee that the team 
would nOl talk to any other city. I Ie 
would not leave the door open fur 
more threats when the City refu cd 
to pay for tllC sradi um. 

Hopefully the situation can be 
worked out with little incident. 
Hopefully, the Chargers will nego-
tiate a quick deal to stay In San 
Diego for 3 very long time . 
Hopefully.

Vending: ERC dean retaining vending funds 
continued from page I 

million. To address these cuts, there 
was a 5 percent across-the-board 
cut in the Studem Affairs registra-
tion fee budget. The possible 20 
percent budget reduction is a num-
ber that was proposed by Gov. Gray 
Davis and is a figure Watson hopes 
will be reduced. 

"We're trying to plan carefully 
for this in a way that will minimize 
the adverse effects on students and 
also try and minimize the adverse 
effects on staff," Watson said. 

Watson said the overall 20 per-
cem cut would be more specifically 
distributed across all the depart-
ments by cutting funding to some 
more tha n others. 

"Wc're not going to make close 
to 20 percent cuts in all depart-
ments," he said. "But some depart-
ments might get cuts much deeper 
than 20 percent, and others much 
less than 20 percent." 

The college councils, which 
have traditionally received vending 
machine allocations at the discre-
tion of their college'S deans, may 
have to do without the allocation as 
early as next year because the col -
lege deans may look to the alloca-
tions as a means to supplement 
deep budget cuts. 

Already, the overall vending 
machll1c allocations distributed by 
I lousing and Dining Services to 
the college deans' offices has 
declined si nce last year due to 
decrea ed use of campus vending 
machines and the addition of Sixth 
College, which causcd the overall 
allocation to be further divided. 

"A large part of it has to do with 
a lot of [coffee] carts and other dif-
ferem enterprises set up on cam-
pus," said Thurgood Marshall 
College Dean of Studem Affairs 
Ashami Houston-Hands. "A lot of 
people will tend to go to those 
place, and it will tend to cur back 
on vendlllg rna hines." 

This year, the base allocation for 
each college is $1,456. Additionally, 
each college receives a proportional 
amount based on a rate of $104 1 per 
student registered for fall enroll-
ment. The large t allocation went 
to Earl Warren College at $6,144 
and was fo llowed by John Muir 
College, Marshall college, Revelle 
College and Eleanor Roosevelt 
College. The smallest amount, 
$1,751, went to Sixth College. 

Already, Patricia Scott, dean of 
Snldent Affairs at ERC, has decid-
ed to retain the $4,691 vending 
machine allocation to make up for 
budget cuts to her office, which 
have amounted 10 about $2,000 and 
were announced in mid-January, 
according to SCOtt. 

Scott defended retaining the 
enti re allocation, citi ng the 20 per-
cent Cll ts anticipated for next year. 

"Up until this year, we have 
made those funds available to our 
student council," Scott said. 
"However, in light of the budget 
cuts and in light of the referendum 
passing, it has been my position thiS 
year to provide for programs that 
will still benefit students, but that 
come out of my office. I will retain 
this money this year." 

con said she wanted to main-
tain her office's "wide variety" of 
college programs, which include 
leadership, cultural, recreation and 
social programs. 

SCOtt says the allocation was 
retained after notifying the Student 
Council of Eleanor Roosevelt 
College of the decision. 

For SCERC Chair Barish 
andagopal, the loss of the yearly 

allocation is made up for by the 
recently passed college fee refer-
endum that provides SCERC with 
a $5 per student per quarter 
income and that amounts to about 
$15,000 a quarter. 

"['m glad that she consulted 
with uS before she withheld the 

money," he said. "I understand why 
she did it. I probably would have 
done the same in her position , 
because of the budget cuts." 

At Warren college, Dean of 
Student Affairs Jeffrey Philpott said 
that while his office has traditional-
ly given the allocation to Warren 
College Snldent COllncil, the threat 
of budget cuts may affect whether 
his office retains the allocation. 

"I can't say that next year things 
won 't be different, because we will 
lose funding and things change, so 
until we get directions from the 
vicc chancellor's office, I can't say 
right now what's going to happen 
to the money next year," he said. 

ot all colleges, however, plan 
on retaining the money. At Muir 
college, Dean of Student Affairs 
Patricia Mahaffey said she is looking 
for alternative ways to supplement 
cuts in order to give next year's allo-
cation to Muir College Council. 

"I'm somewhat resistant from 
taking the vending machine moncy 
away from MCC," she said. 

Mahaffey said she might cut 
funding from her office that gocs to 
student groups and organizations, 
and instead have those groups go to 
MCC for all their funding. 

MCC, which is currently bene-
fiting from a recently passed fee 
referendum, is operating with a 
budget of $9~,850. 

Currently, Mahaffey said that her 
office enacted a hiring freeze and 
would not be replacing the colleges 
activity coordinator until this sum-
mer. She also said that cuts were 
made to money going to support 
snldent workers, but in return the 
college covers that money directly. 

Four of the six colleges -
Revelle, Muir, Marshall and ERC 
- passed fee referenda that have 
already given the councils larger 
budgets. Both Warren college and 

ixth College are considering 
proposing their own fcc referenda.

and fund programs and new initia-
tives that build campus unity, pride 
and spirit." The passage of an athlet-
ics feferendum during the 2002-03 
school year by students is also cited 
as evidence that students support 
growth 111 athletics. 

The resolution also addresses a 
general lack of financial support for 
athletics that has "made it nearly 
impo sible [for the department] to 
develop a decisive and strategic 
plan for long tefm goals." 

"There's been a continuing pat-
tern of finan ial uncertainty for the 
athletic department," Shelton said. 
"This is unacceptable, given that 
student life quality is so poor on 
campus and that students have 
expr ed desire for wa}''S to raise 
school spirit." 

Edwards welcomed student sup-
port for the athletic department. 

"Any suppOrt from students to

BEST ASIAN FOOD 
JASMINE SEAFOOD RESTAURANT 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

Making an Asian restaurant stand out among the multitude of shops and 
dining locations on Asian-dom-
inated Convoy Street is nOI 
easy, but jasmine Seafood 
Restaurant certainly lives up to 
the ta.~k . 

Much of jasmine's success in 
establishing its reputation lies 
III the fresh Chi nese food it 
serves. Compared to other 
Chinese restaurants in the San 
DIego area, jasmine adheres 
much more to the traditional 
methods and fla vors of the 
Canton region. Thus the taste 
is definitely better (and that's 
always a plus). 

ome specialties to try 
include the sauteed scallop and 
shrimp with Sz.echuan sauce; 
shiitake mushrooms with oy ter 
auce; and the Pelc.ing duck, 

which is carved right at the 
table. The clay pots brimming 
with seafood, vegetables and 
meat will make your mouth 
water. A variety of soups are 
offered; the upremc seafood 
with bean curd soup is definite-
I y worth a try. 

Fresh seafood can be 
ordered rsght out of the tanlc.s, 
al though some fish entrees are 
priced by the pound. If you love 
fl h, imply try a whole teamed 
fi h entree - you're guaranteed 
to love the freshness and taste. 

Jasmine is also one of the 
best places in San Diego for 
dim sum (literally meaning 
"touchi ng the heart" in 
Chinese) : small, bite-size 
mor els of a variety of meats, 
dumplings, veggies and desserts 
served with your choice of a 
traditional Chinese tca. Treats 
to try include the steamed 
shrimp dumplings, nlrnip cake 
and egg custard tarts. jasmine 
offers over 50 kinds of these 
delicaCies, with an even greater 
selection on weekends. Dim 
sum is served daily from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m. 

I n addItion to great food, 
jasll11ne offers excellent ser-
vice and a comfortable, pa-
CIOUS seatsng arrangement. 
The wai tresses, some dressed 
in traditional hinese chi pao 
dre ses, and waiters are 
friendly and helpful. Although 
there are many tables, most of 
them are filled during lunch 
and dinner hours. jasmine also 
offers a bar for tho e 21 and 
over. 

Quite popular in the Asian 
community for business meet-
ings, banquettes and gather-
ings of friends and family, 
Jasmine is the place to go for 
authentic Chinese food at fair-
ly reasonable prices. 

The resturant is located at 
4609 onvoy St. III 
Clalremont Mesa; for more 
snformation call (858) 268-

BEST CONCERT VENUE 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Hiatus Editor 

San Diego's rock scene has been trudging along for many a year, with many highs and 
lows along the way. A lengthy local 
history has been developing to 
accompany the plethora of bands 
that either form here or just decide 
to ca ll America's Finest City home. 
Since 1989, many of these acts and 
national group have played at The 
Casbah, downtown an Diego's 
premier spOt to ee alt rock, post 
grunge, rock 'n' roll, post punk or 
Just about any other of rock's 
sounds from there and back. 

THE CASBAH 
Moving to its current location, 

2051 Kettner Blvd. (near the air-
port), in 199-l and more than dou-
bling ItS capacity, the club has 
be'come a San Diego hot spot. 
Boasting multiple rooms, including 
a game room and a music room 
with a 24-channel sound system, 
each with a bar and an enclosed 
smoking patio, the facility i 
equipped to meet the needs of con-
certgoers who seek a good time. 

The schedule is hectic and 
relencles ; most weeks have music 
every night. In fact, for the entire 
month of March, the only day that 
doesn't have an event listed is 
March 27 . Rockin' the house 29 

days a month peaks volume dbo ut 
its attitude, which focuses o n Is~ ­
tening to great mu ic Jnd haVIng a 
good time. 

The CJsbah is exclusively 21 
and up with valid ID, of course, so 
you grommets (or booger-eaters, 
better known as the under-age 
crowd) better find another venue to 
call home for a few years; but if you 
are among the legally-able-to-
drink crowd and love a solid rock 
show, then find your way down to 
The Casbah and find out why 
everyone from jon Spencer Blues 
Explosion, to The Cult, to the 
Rugburns gets down there. Rock 
on man. 

BEST SPRING BREAK 
MEXICO 

By DEENA AL SHAm 
Staff Writer 

so its ninth week. pring break looms just around the corner, but where do you go? Since its 
just a few hours away, Mexico is the 
preferred place for U 0 tudents 
to go for spring break. Mexico offers 
a wide range of things to do, from 
clubbing to tanning on the beach, 0 
its ea y to see why it was voted No. 
I. ne of the be t things Mexico ha 
to offer is the nightlife. Di co , 
disco- bars and bar are offered 
throughout the country. 

Tijuana in particular is very pop-
ular among UCSD students. It's a 
big party town, with many clubs 
and bars that aren't as expensive as 
ones in the United States . The 
cheap places charge less than $ I for 
a beer or as little as $3 for a blend-
ed drinlc or a shot. although ome of 
the more upscale places can charge 
more. Since the drinking age is only 
18, a opposed to 21 in the United 
tates, it is accessible to more of the 

U 0 population . 
However, clubbll1g and pub-

hopping isn't the only thing to do in 
Mexico. Many go to Mexico to 

relax and see the sight . Cancun is a 
very popular location. It has the 
nightlife as well as day crUise, 
night cruise and shows to see . 
Cabo San Lucas is another 
favorite . Although Cabo ha J 
thriving nightlife, it i also well -
known a a relaxation pot. 

.. abo is very relaxing and very 
beautiful - I would go there a~in 
in a heartbeat,~ aid john Muir 
College junior Daniel iecek. 

So for a fun spring break. head on 
over to Mexico for dancing, relaxmg 
and JU t enjoying not simng 111 a

pleasant spot for a latte. 

The coffee house's popularity

the Pacific Beach boardwalk,

BEST SUSHI 
SUSH I OTA 

By LISA MAK 
Staff Writer 

Tucked away in a corner of a small plaza in Pacific Beach, between a 7-11 
and a hair salon, is a treasure 
trove for sushi lovers. Sushi Ot3, 
owned by master sushi chef 
Yukito Ota, is undoubtedly one 
of the beSt sushi bars in San 
Diego. 

Walking into Sushi Ota, 
don't expect flashy decorations 
and waitresses dressed in 
Iomonos. The decor can be 
described as minimalist, with 
simple but comfortable chairs 
and tables, and cei ling lamps 
that give the relatively small 
re taurant a soft glow. The 
overall atmosphere is very 
casual and laid back, unhke 
most traditIOnal Japanese 
reStaurants. Rather than focus-

BEST RESTAU RANT 
FOREVER FONDUE 

By JESSICA LONG 
Senior Staff Writer 

Once again, Forever Fondue was voted UCSD students' favorite restaurant. ot 
surprising, considering that mis 
unique restaurant offers a fun 
evening for a romantic dinner or 
a few good laughs with some 
friends. 

Located on Prospect Street in 
La Jolla, just a few minutes from 
campus, Forever Fondue offers a 
beautifuJ view of the sea along 
with a bird's-eye view of down-
town La Jolla. The restaurant is 
small, which gives it a very cozy 
feel. 

This is definitely a good place 
to go for a slow evening, since a 
complete meal can take about 
two hours to get through. Also, 

you do have to cook all of the 
food yourself at the table. 
However, it IS more than worth 
the time it takes to prepare and 
eat tile food. 

Meals begin with a cheese 
fondue of American Cheddar, 
Queso Baja or European Swiss 
with french, pumpernickel and 
rye bead, Granny Smith apples, 
celery, carrOts, and cauliflower. 
This is followed by either a 
house or caesar salad (the only 
part of the meal you don't have 
to cook). Next is the main 
course, consisting of a variety of 
vegetables (stuffed mushroom 
caps, zucchini , carrots, bro coli 
and red potatoes), meat (filet 
mignon, marinated teriyaki sir-
loin and boneless chicken breast)

BEST FAST FOO D 
I N - N -OUT 

By RINALDO DORMAN 
Hiatus Editor 

When it comes to fast-food, the burger joint is the reigning champion, and 
In-N-Out si ts at the top of that 
heap in the eycs of UCSD stu -
dents. Known for the simplicity 
of its menu, [n-N-Out focuses on 
the mainstay of fas t food: the holy 
trin ity of burge rs, fr ies and 
shakcs. 

With onl y d few menu devia-
tions, you are left with minimalist 
approach to ordcring: hamburger, 
cheese burger, doubl e cheese-
burger (Double-Double); fri es; 
chocolate, vanilla or trawberry 
rrulkshake; or soda . 

There are also a few non -
menu items that have become 
notorious, and are variances to 
meet peopl c', di etary require-
ments and taste preferences. 
Most are fa miliar with "animal 
styl e," whIch is grilled onIons 
and pickles cooked up with the 
meat. 

Strangest of these IS the "pro-
tein -style" burger. For those who 
adhere to the At ki ns diet , they 

will wrap the burger 111 lettuce 
instead of putting it in a bun. For 
vegetarians who srill enjoy the 
ambiance or are simply dragged 
there by roommates, lovers or 
drunks, there is the grill ed 
cheese. 

Meataterians will enjoy the 3-
by-3 and 4-by-4; why have a sim-
pI c Double- Double when you ca n 
have three or four meat patties 
and as many cheese ~ Ii ces? Why 
even stop there? You can go as big 
as you want to - think you could 
tackle a 6-by-6? They'll serve it 
up. 

Of course, the fact that In- -
Out is open un ti l I a.m. Sundays 
through Thursdays, and 1:30 
a.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 
always helps meet the needs of a 
late-night craving; and let's be 
honest, after midni ght is the best 
time for fast-food. With well 
over 200 locations in tllrce States, 
and 12 of those in San Diego 
Coun ty alone, you are sure to 
find one nearby, even near cam-
pus. For more information on

LOU'S RECORDS 
By BILLY GIL 

StaHWnter 

YOU will love and hate Lou 's Records. This s tatement hould speak volumes to fel -
low obsessive record -buyers. 
Love it because you can find pret-
ty much anything you want there, 
if not used, then new at a decent 
price. You will hate it because you 
will not be able go there without 
bu}'! ng a disgusting amount of 
CDs. Obsessive-compulsive buy-
ers: You have been warned. 

" t at only do they stock Iittle-
known records, but their staff is 
knowl edgeable and helpful ," said 
T hu rgood 1arshall College 
juni or Kate Leiserson. "They 
won't look at you like, ' Uh, how 
'bout some Sum 41 ?' when you 
ask for somethmg rare." 

T his writer's personal experi-
ence has proven this to be true on 
a recent trip up 1-5 to Encinitas to 
VIsi t Lou's on "journalistic 
research." T his was in no waya n 
excuse to buy even more CDs. As 
often done when visiti ng Lou's, [ 
asked one of the random workers 
a question regarding merchandise 
and, as usual, was pleasantly ur-
pnsed with the response . 

"I ley. Do you know Pavement 
"ell''' I ask a gIrl 1V0rkJng there. 

"Yea h," 
'" \'ell , do yo u t1l1nk It'S wortll 

It to bu)' thiS 'alhllm lSI anted and 
Enchantcd, used for 699], or 
should I bu}' the nl'W one 1.1 ncw 

refurbished version with bonus 
tracks for 12.99J?" 

"Hmm, well if you're not too 
fa miliar with the band ye t, I'd say 
go for the cheaper one." 

Polite, to-the-point and , most 
of all , accurate. T his is the kind of 
service that should be expected 
from record reta ilers but is sadly 
not always the case. Instead of 
giving nasty looks or arrogant 
qu ips at musica l inqui ries (no 
"you mean you don't already have 
that?" looks), the Lou 's Records 
staff is top notch. 

Of course, custOmer service 
would be nothing without a prod-
uct to serve. In tcrms of quanti ty 
and price, there is no comparison 
in the San Diego area. Got old 
CDs to get rid of'! Is that 

ickelback C D collectin g dust on 
your shel f (well , what the hell were 
you thinking 111 the first place)? 
Trade them in and collect money 
or store credit. Case in point: I 
traded in four old, somewhat taste-
less albums and bought a new one 
and four used ones. Total amount 
spent: less than $30. Score! 

If further convi ncing IS need-
ed, Lou's consists of three ec-
tions, one for new stuff, one for 
old, and one for DVD and video. 
Lou 's also regularly conmbUles to

n-tE UCSO GUARDIAN THURSDAY. MARCH 6.2003 

'Stomp' triumphantly returns to San Diego 
The famous percussive group brings the noise to the Civic Center 

By JESSICA KRUSKAMP 
Senior Staff Writer 

"S TOMP" is an event where 
the performers clap for the 
audience, then the audience 

jumps to its feet homing for more. 
Impossible as it may seem, buckets, 
bodies and brooms morph from the 
painfully mundane to exotic instru-
ments in "T M.p''' an exceptional 
live show of percus ion and move-
ment. 

"STO 1P" features eight highly 
talented cast members who snatch 
items from their real-world caJling, 
such as water jugs, pots, pans, sinks, 
garbage cans and lighters, and use 
them to showcase their rhythmic 
sen ibilities. Each of the cast mem-
bers vibrate with talent, their arms 
muscled from the constant repeti-
tious drumming. 

These people are good. Their 
energy is contagious, their faces are 
open to their excitement and their 
smiles are obvious. They know 
they're good. They have to have 
that confidence - after all, to be 
able to perform a routine with six 
ba ketballs where anything, even 
one misplaced bounce, could throw 
the pace off is risky. 

The beats utterly riveted the 
people watching, most of whom 
were unable to quell their own 
movements to the sounds of open-
ing night at the an Diego Civic 
Theatre on March 4. But 
.. TOMP" is not just a rapid gun-
fire of sounds. ot even clo e. 

and IS used to deaden steps and 
enhances huffling. Five-gallon 
water jugs make hollow tones. Zippo 
lighters spark on and off, momentar-
ily brightening a dark stage and col-

REVIEW 

lectively clacking a beat. 
And, of course, "STOMP" is not 

just cadenced noise. Yes, between the 
clapping, stomping of the feet and 
making squeaky noises with a 
kitchen sink and rubber gloves, 
"STOMP" manages to squeeze in 
humor. 

Wordless, the cast uses physical 
visual comedy to keep the atmos-
phere light and exciting. The 
humor is simple, yet engages the 
audience further into the perfor-
mance. Not only can these cool cats 
make some incredible sounds with 
objects that are usually discarded in 
life, they are seriously witty. 

Wit devoid of words is a unique 
experience, and "STOMP" knows 
exactly how to deliver it. One troupe 
member i the main source of the 
no-talk humor, obviously the butt of 
many jokes and who causes the most 
fru tration with purposeful bad tim-
ing. 

"STOMP" proves that a perfor-
mance can neglect words in favor of 
ound. It makes the show universaUy 

accessible and snipped of dialogue; 
the audience can focus on potential 
inert tempos in every inanimate 
object in a seemingly boring space. 

The set amplifies that rationale . 
Two stories high, the set is a part of 
the performance. The cast climbs on 
it, su pends themselves from it, 
swings arollnd and drums on the 
road signs, metal siding, pans and 
pipes that are affixed to it. The set is 
a jumble of miscellaneous items

from any urban street, but in 
"STOMP," thcse items meld to be 
an integral part of the show. 

Directors Luke Cresswell and 
Steve Mc Icholas were hanging 
arOlmd Brighton, U.K. , one day in 
1991, and spawned an idea that 
would become "STOMP" It was the 
rcsult of a 1 O-year creative partner-
ship that had produced the band 
Pookiesnackenbllrgcr, in which they 
used trashcans as instruments. 

Sound familiar? 
Fast forward a few months, and 

Cresswell and Mc icholas were 
pnxillcing, directing and financing 
the original production of 
"STOMP." It premiered at the 
Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh, 
Scotland, where it began garnering 
awards like the "Critic's Choice" and 
the Daily Exprw' "Best of the 
Fringe." At the end of the 1991 tour, 
"STOMP" was nominated for an 
Oliver nomination for Best 
Entertainment (think Tony Award) 
and won the Best Choreography 
award. 

"STOMP" toured England, 
Australia, Greece and Japan, and 
evenrually began its American run in 

ew Yorks rphcum Theater in 
1994. In the United States, it fea-
tured an all-Anlcrican cast for the 
first timc, sold out a national tour 
and reaped awards like the Drama 
De k Award for Most Uniquc 
Theatre Experience. 1\vo more 
American productions were created. 
and have been on tour since 1995. 

"STOMP" wtll run through 
March 9 at dlC an Diego Civic 
Theatre downtown at 3rd and . B 
Street. Tickets run from $24 to $67, 
but with the explosive sowlds, dlere 
are no real bad cats in the house.

UCSD played hard and took a 6-2 lead 
mto the half. Upset that it did not capItalize 
on sevcral scoring opporrunities, UC 0 set 
out to dommate commg out of the break. 
The Tntons succeeded, possessing the ball 
almost all of the third quarter and scoring 
five goals. Led by Dave Miller, US came 
back, capltahzi ng on everal man-up oppor-
tunltlc; m the fourth quarter. But UCSD 
ealed the game with a pair of goals and was 

able to get the enure team some valuable 
game time experience. The Tntons' offeme 
was paced by I icholas Dean, Ross tensrud 
and ,\l3n LaFiandra, a well as InJdfieIders 
Phd mlth and Bret Loughndge. 
Defensemen Chns \Va hll1gton and Brandon 
Hars also had standout games. Goahe Wade 
Tam continued his hot goal tending, regi tcr-
ing 13 saves.

Quiche Roura and Andy \\lang both took 
third place, and Eric Smith finished in sec-
ond place overall in each of their respective

UCSD club sports go on unrecognized 
continued from page 20 

worked together to get a winning 
time of 6:22 for the 2,OOO-rneter 
race. 

"UCI has a new coach, and 
their varsity eight was the fastest 
we have seen in a while," Filippone 
said. 

UCSD, which was behind for 
the first 1,000 meters, was still able 
to pull ahead at the dog-leg and 
continued to gain seats consistently 
throughout the race. 

The team's goal is to reach its 
peak strength and condition in 

time for the Western 
Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships so 
that the varsity eight can qualify to 
com pete at the Avaya 
Championships in Princeton, N .j., 
in early May. 

The team has another dual meet 
against Long Beach State next

Pum's 
Points 

Anu Kumar 

H ere at UCSD, we have a few different levels of competition. First, there 
is the intercollegiate athletics 
(which sometimes looks like it's at 
the high chool level), and then on 
the other side of the spectrum, we 
have intramural sports (which 
sometimes looks like it's slightly 
more competitive than the high 
school level). And somewhere in 
the middle lies club sportS. 

It's too bad that some of 
UCSD's club sports teams get no 
more attention than a CalPIRG 
officer on Library Walk. The ulti-
mate teams are JUSt two examples 
of the few club SpOrts squads that 
deserve more recognit.ion than 
some of the Triton intercollegiate 

teams (err ... men's basketball). 
The women's ultimate disc 

team is the defending national 
champion and is currently 
ranlced No.4 in the nation, while 
the men's team is ranked No. 7. 

And the UCSD surfing team 
cannot go without being men-
tioned. Representing a university 
that Sports fIIustraud declared the 
tOP surf chool in the nation, the 
surfing team has won four nation-
al titles in the last IS years, and 
UCSD currently sitS in second 
place in the Southwest 
Conference this year. If the fact 
that club sports teams acrually sit 
in the middle to the top of the 
standings in their respective divi-
sions (which is more than could 
be said for many intercollegiate 
teams) is not deserving of respect, 
then maybe their independence is. 

The legal guardians 
(AsSOCIated Students) provide 
Club Sports an allowance that is 
smaller than the amount of 
cha nge undemeath your sofa, and 
the teams rely on fundraisers and 

their own wallets to cover the 
costs of uansportation lO events, 
equipment, coaches, and referees 
for games . 

My only gripe about club 
sportS, however, is that half of the 
teams don't call themselves 
Tritons . Instead of taking the 
name of the UCSD mascot, teams 
like men 's ultimate calls ItS self the 
Air quids and women's ultimate 
goes by the name Psycaughtit. If 
you are going to represent 
UCSD, then do it with pride and 
with the proper name. If more of 
the club sportS teams called them-
selves the Tritons, they could help 
build up the school's reputation 
with some wrnning. 

With or without the right litle, 
though, I don't think club sPOrts 
teams will ever get the recoglll -
tion that most of them have 
earned.

"The course was completely 
drenched, and we had rain both 
rounds on Monday and Tuesday, 
but the team persevered in spite of 
it," Wydra said.
