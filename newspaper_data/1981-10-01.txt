Lette r s to the Editor 

In support of 
creation science 
Editor: 

After reading "The Age of 
Rocks and the Rock of Ages," 
(Guardian, Sept. 28) by 
Nathaniel Wander, I feel it is 
necessary for me to respond to 
some misconceptions and 
misinformation presented in 
his article. 

First I mu ·t explain 'ome of 
my background concerning 
the creation·evolution debat e. 
r wa educated in public 
schools through high school 
and earned a B.S. degree in 
biology from a secu lar 
university (USC). A ' 'uch, the 
only 'ide of the issue I ever 
heard wa ' the evolutioni ·ts ' . 
Even the church I attended 
was liberal and believed in 
theistic evo lu t io n (God 
causing all orga nisms to 
evolve to higher forms). It was 
not until r was 20 year old 
that I began listening to the 
scientific creationi · t ' 
viewpoints and still another 
year until I began accepting 
them as va lid sc ientifi c 
theories. 

I have elaborated on my 
background to 'how that I 
have been on both sides of the 
issue. In reading Mr. Wander's 
article I can under ·tand his 
misconceptions. 

The first involves hi s 
feelings toward allowing equal 
time for creationism in the 
science classroom. He echoes 
the thoughts of many who 
imagine a biology class filled 
with students, each having a 
biology text book on one side of 
the desk and the Bible on the 
other. Thi picture however is 
totally false. Hardly anyone 
advocates the use of the Bible 
in the science classrooms of 
pu b1ic schools (not even Jerry 
FallweJl !) What many wish to 
see is a curriculum that 
expl o res t he scientific 
eVIdences either supporting or 
contradicting each theory. 

There are only two ways to 
describe the origin of life: 
either it firs t appeared in its 
present form (creationism) or 
it did not (evolution). There 
are no intermediates and it 
becomes obvious that it is 
unneccessary to dist ingu ish 
between Christian creation 
and the accou nts of other 
faith s. 

Wander claims, as mo ·t 
evolutioni ·ts do, that the 
creat ion side ha 'i "No theory, 
no hypotheses, no testing, no 
refinl'rnent , and above all , no 
dissent. Nothing is in fact, but 
the words of Genesis .... " This 
statement is ridiculous, and it 
shows its author know s 
nothing of the creation s ide 
and has never read a s ingle 
book or article discus ' ing 
scientific creationism. 

The scientific creationists 
examine such topics as the 

First and Second Laws of 
Thermodynamics, the paleon· 
tological (foss il) record, the age 
of the earth according to a 
variety of radiometric dating 
techniques, stratigraphic 
sedimentation, genetic 
mutat ions, and the list goes 
on. 

The scientific creationists 
can and do make hypotheses 
and test to see how well 
observa ble phenomenon 
correlate to their model. For 
example, thecreationi t would 
lJredict that all organisms 
were created at a stage of 
greatest perfection and 
s ubs equently have been 
deteriorating or becoming less 
perfect through time. • 

This conform s perfectl y 
with the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics which 
states that a system proceeds 
towards a state of higher 
ent ropy (greater di sorder). 
The evolutionary theory 
contradicts the Second Law 
because evolution proceeds to 
a st ate of lower ent ropy 
(greater order). The evolution· 
ist will counter by saying that 
this law is valid only under 
closed sys tems (where no 
energy can enter or leave) and 
evolution proceeds in an open 
system. Yet the great French 
scientist and mathematician , 
Em il Borel, has prove n 
mathematically that no 

sy~tem is closed. This has 
been acknowledged by David 
Layzer, a professor of 
astronomy at Harvard 
University: "Borel showed 
that no finite physical system 
can be considered closed 
(Scientific American, Decem· 
ber 1975). 

I have singled in on only one 
point to illustrate that 
creationists do not use Genesis 
as the only support for their 
theories. From a scientific 
standpoint I would agree that 
it is wrong to use a religious 
document as the sole support 
for a theory. 

It is interesting to note that 
in debates between scientists 
on thi s iss ue , it is the 
evolutionist who keeps 
bringing up the Bible, Genes is, 
Adam and Eve, and the six 
day s of creation. The 
creationists many times have 
stressed they do not wish to 
debate on religious concepts 
but only on science and have 
asked that discussions revolve 
around the fossil record, 
genetics, geology, and the laws 
of science. 

I cou ld go on indefinitely 
with this but space (and your 
time) is limited . I will not go 
any furt her t han question ing 
why Mr. Wander finds it 
necessary to support evolution

No man is everything 
BY PAUL FARWELL 

"Michael Fitzkowski disappoints me, my 
mother disappoints me, everyone di sappoints 
me," Sanderson said. 

I didn't bother to ask what he was gelling aLl 
walked into the kitchen and grabbed another 
beer out of the ice box. 

"And you know what else is a let down ?" 
Sanderson yelled from the living room. 

"What?" I yelled back. "This shitty beer is." r 
visited Sanderson only twice after I kicked him 
out of my aprJrtment. I"m not one whocon~ lder~ 
cleanliness nt-xl to goodliness. hut Sanden.on 's 
s loppiness was becoming an embarrassment. I 
kicked him OUI after the landlady complained 
for the fifteent h I ime. anderson departed in 
September, leaving one of his artisticcreat ions, 
a mass of glossy blue plaster, in the basement of 
my apartment. 

Sanderson moved into a large clus ter of 
apartments on E street, the lowest rent district 
in town. The corridors of his apartment 
building were dimly lit and the tiled floors 
always looked a urine yellow. But he seemed to 
have made himself comfortable in his modest 
little flat. He had bought an old sofa, a frosted 
glass chandelier and a squeaking electric fan at 
a swap meet, and with these things he 
decorated his apartment. The old sofa sagged 
and its corners were rounded , sort of like 
Sanderson's s houlders. He was slumped back 
into it, gazing off into space. 

"You're gelling a little dumpy," I said , 
pointing to the flab which hung out over his 
belt. 

"Yeah," he siad, sticking his fat finger into 
the holes of his white undershirt, "Sure looks 
like it, doesn't it?" 

Sanderson's mother, Mrs. Sanderson Franks 
senior, was - before she gave birth to Sandr on 
Franks junior - a reknowned conert piani ·t 
who wanted desparately for her son to follow in 
her footsteps, As a li ttle kid, Sanderson 
pounded on the family piano so hard in protest 
that Mrs. Franks was forced to ca ncel her son's 
piano lessons. The next Christmas, Sanderson 
was given a set of toy drums which were 
quickly broken. Through high school, he 
bounced from one hobby to the next u ntil he 
discovered abstract art. There he fo und a home. 

"Have you heard from your mother recen tly ," 
I asked . 

"Yeah," Sanderson said , "She writes me 
every once in a while. But I never write back. All 
she ever says is Michael Fitzkowski this and 
Michael Fitzkowski that. He's t he asshole who 
lives next door. He's going to Harvard Law next 
year ." 

The electric fan was purring in the corner. 
The glass chandelier was rocking s lowly back 
and forth . Sanderson looked up at it. 

"My mother just can 't understand why I 
think Michael Fitzkowski is an asshole," he 
paused to put down t he rest of the beer, 
"Sometimes J think Fitzkowski is in my folks 
will more than I am. I mean, that's how my 
mot her carries on. And to think, this whole 
thing started so innocent ly one day with an 
acceptance s lip from Harvard Law. Mrs. 
Fitzkowski got to spreading the news , my 
mother got to listening, and the next thing you 
know, a monster is born . Fitzskow 'ki is so 
conceited now he won'ttalk to anyone. He won't 
even look at me," 

Sanderson was steadying t he sw inging 
chandelier wit h his finger. He chuck led lightl y. 

"And just think. this is the guy I used to play 

cops and robbers with. Little whimpy Michael 
Fitzkowsk i. He wet his bed until he was 
fou rteen . " 

I was laughing. 
"And you know what 's more," Sanderson 

said , "Fitzkowski isn ' t the genius everyone 
thinks he is . I mean, what is Harvard Law?" 

"Well, some mindless droid like Fitzkowsk i 
might think it an achievement. r mean, he's the 
type of guy who wakes up thinking, 'God, I 
mus t be a genius , I'm going to Harvard Law 
next yea:-.' I'll have to explain to him what a 
genius is somt.: ime." 

The fan began squeaking again and 
Sanderson took off a shoe to heave at it. r was 
looking up at one of anderson's paintings 
called "Sex Without Love." It was a large, 
rectangular canvass, caked with bright red, 
brown, and black oil paints. The slashes of 
bright red paint were supposed to signify virgin 
blood. Sanderson explained this to me while he 
was crea ting it on the front porch of my 
apartment one evening last summer. 

Sanderson was about ready to take off his 
other shoe when the fan stopped squeaking. He 
slumped back into the sofa. 

"Fitzkowski thinks that playing clarinet in 
your high school marching band qualifies 
someone to be an artist ." Sanderson chuckled. 
" Fitzkows ki once told me that Simon and 
Garfunkel was art . Art to a Michael Fitzkowski 
is the applique on the back of designer jeans." 

Sanderson belched deeply. 
"You know what's art?" 
"What?" I asked . 
"That," he sa id. pointing to a large phallic· 

like sculpture sitting in the corner of the room 
"That 's art." 

He paused for a second to finish belching and 
looked at me. 

"So do you now understand why Michael 
Fitzkowski is an asshole?" 

The li~ht was slowly swaying between us. 
"I don t know, Sanderson," I said, " I th ink 

you're a little bitter , maybe. I mean , you're not 
doin' too hot here yourself." 

"Yeah ," he said, looking around his dumpy 
apartment, " I guess you cou ld look a t it that 
way .. J used to worry a lot about being a fu ck up. 
A lot. Un like Fitzkowski, I'd wake up in the 
morning and think , 'God, I'm a tuck up.' I used 
to dread readi ng my mother's letters because 
that's a ll s he'd ta lk about. I mean, how cou ld r 
jus tify myself living when t here was a Michael 
Fitzkowski loose in the world . 

"But you know what?" 
"What?" 
"If Fitzkowski came around these parts I'd 

have to tell him the truth . I'd have to tell him 
thai no man is everything." 

I started laughing. 
"You know what," r said, smiling, "You've 

done it again . You're right. You're absolutely 
right." 

I got up to get another beer out of the kitchen . 
I noticed one of Sanderson's polyester resin 
tinker toy sculptures on the kitchen table. A 
thought occurred, but I suppressed it. "No man 
is everything," I thought , "But some men 
maybe nothing." 

Sanderson belched again from the 
livingroom .

Pitiful. That word be ·t 
describes the condition of 
UCSD's computer science 
laboratories. The need for 
more "Terak" mini-computers 
is especially acute. Many 
hundreds of students are 
flooding into computer science 
c1asse . at UCSD and the EECS 
dept. is ill ·equipped to handle 
the numbers . Instead crude 
attempts are made at limiting 
the number of people in the 
major. The EECS dept. trie ' 
its best, cited by a recent 
upgrade of floppy drives, but 
seems to be plagued by budget 
problems. It' s truly unbeliev· 
able that a school a ' large, 
tech nical. and prestigious as 
UCSD would have difficulty 
mustering up fund s for such 
esse ntial and c ritical 
equipme nt. Especially 
cons idering the great demand 
for computer specialists in this 
country and the skyrocket ing 
computer industry right here 
in San Diego.

KKK: 
• terror IS 

a business 
BY FRANK BROWNING 

Pacific News Service 
The worst attacks began a 

little more than a year ago. As 
Harold Phipps at on his front 
porch in a housing project near 
this San Francisco Ea t Bay 
community, a Chevy pickup 
camper cruised slowly down 
the s treet for the second time. 
Su ' picious, Phipps told 
everyone to get inside . In ~he 
next few , tense moments , lIve 
shots rang out from a black 
rifle barrel poked out the back 
door of the camper. The 
truck 's engine gave a roar and 
disappeared . 

Phipps is a Mexican, but the 
apparent target of the shooting 
was a black neighbor, lunoel 
Guess , who previously had 
been s ubjected to white 
harassment. 

The attack was no surprise 
to the many blacks who live in 
the project and in the nearby 
towns here in Contra Costa 
County. They say they have 
suffered a steady escalation of 
racial violence in recent years 
- so much so that legal 
inve -tigator ' now believe that 
the Ku Klux Klan has come to 
u 'e the area as one of its 
prin c ipal We s t C o a s t 
recruiting grounds. 

As a result of thi s and other 
attacks, black people here have 
learned to be afraid -afraidof 
teen ·age toughs plowing 
through their lawns , afraid of 
rock s thrown through their 
windows , of crosses burnt into 
their lawns, afraid of white 
sheets draped aero " their 
car '. 

On Oct. 5th, the California 
Fair Employment and Hous ing 
Commi 's ion will open four 
da ys of hearings into racial 
v iolen ce and hara ssment 
within Contra Costa County, 
foc us ing on a eries of attacks 
that las ted through the final 
'ix months of las t year. 

In the meantime , the attacks 
are continuing: In Augus t a 
black family 's hous e in 
Rollingwood was firebombed . 
Another black family who had 
moved into the neighborhood 
in mid·Augus t had their house 
s pattered with eggs and 
returned home one day to fine! 
their garage painted with a 
swas tika, a lightning bolt and 
the letters KKK. 

"This used to be a white 
neighborhood until a few 
months ago," one neighb r 
said. 'They mess them over if 
bla cks move in . The y' re 
des troying t his neighborhood 
with their stupid beliefs." 

Lawyers and legal in ves ti · 
gators who have worked with 
black residents and with the 
Commiss ion fear that the new 
school y ar cou Id bring even 
more attacks , especially by the 
proliferating campu s a nd 
neighborhood gangs tha t 
police be li eve ha ve been 
responsible for most of th 
violence to date. 

Discussing the pattern of 
racial attacks, a preliminary 
Commi ss ion report high · 
lighted both the youthfulness 
of the attackers and their 
p r so na l assoc iation with 
adllit KKK m mbers . The 
most common charac terist ics

This valuable piece of

PoJice arrest bike theft suspect 
BY TIM PICKWELL 

UCSD police last Friday 
arrested a man they suspect of 
stealing and then reselling 
bicycles on campus. 

The case against Edward 
Allen Fain, 31. was "presented 
to the district at torney on 
Tuesday and is pending 
prosecution ," according to 
campus Police Chief Hugh 
French. . 

The bikes Fain was selling 
were allegedly pilfered from 

. UCSD and San Diego State 
University. 

The university police first 
became aware of the operation

coed came to police to register 
her recently-purchased bike. 

A routine computer check of 
the serial num ber revealed 
that the bicycle had been 
stolen earlier in the day from 
SDSU. 

The woman had purchased 
the bike. valued at $150, for 
$75 from a man she had 
co l"I .t act edt h r 0 ugh an 
advertisement. 

The ad, according to 
Detective Bob Jones, was a 
s imple three-by-five card 
posted near the UCSD Bike 
Shop. The Bike Shop has no 
connection with either the ad 
or suspect. 

Officers took the ad and 
telephoned the man and set up 
a "meet ing." 

"A police department 
employee, posing as a buyer, 
purchased a stolen bike, 
valued at $350 for $150." 

Fain was arrested on the 
spot. The Vista resident is 
charged with two felony 
counts of posses ___ .lJf stolen 
property. . 

A search of his apartment 
uncovered numerous bicycle 
parts, a bolt cutter and 'everal 
repainted bike frames, A serial 
number on one of the frames 
had been filed off. but the 
number was re 'tored by an 

acid etching process. The bike 
was successfully identified as 
one which had been stolen. 

If convicted, Fain faces a 
possible jail sentence. or 
probation on the condition 
that he pay restitution to his 
victims. 

Detective Murray Penhol-
low stressed the fact that the 
campus poli ce attempt, 
whenever possible, to protect 
the victims_ 

" When we put a ca<;e 
toget her, we always try to 
make re.litution." 

The police urge anyone who 

HEAVY 

may have dealt with the 
suspect to notify them. 

"We could never have made 
this buy-bust without the 
cooperation of the student ," 
says Penhollow. 

He al so suggests that 
stu dent s regi s ter their 
bicycles and report serial 
numbers. 

Jones recommends that the 
"buyer beware." Be _ uspicious 
of "great deal '," and painted 
bikes which lack brand names. 

"We will be happy to check 
on any bike wh ich a I u dent IS 
planning to buy."

Pauling discusses vitatnin C 

By LESLIE FOOTE 
Even at the age of eighty 

Linus Pauling finds the time 
and energy to pursue research 
and remain in the public eye, 
Pauling, who has received two 
Nobel Prizes and done much 
resea rc h in the field of 
orthomolecular medicine, has 
advocated a daily regimen of 
vit ami n C for many years. 
The 'e views on t he pot en t ia I of 
vitamin C ha ve made him the 
center of attention in perhaps 
one of the mos t controvers ial 
s ubject in preventative 
medicine: what is the exact 
role that vitamin C plays in 
maintaining health? In hi s 
most recent book, Vitamh, C 
and Cancer Preventiol1, he a nd 
Dr. Ewan Cameron give 
evidence that large doses of 
vitamin C may be a possible 
mea n ' of treating ca ncer. 
Ca ncer and vitamin C were 
al ' 0 the topics of Dr. Pauling's 
lecture here at UCSD last 
Friday. 

Dr. Pauling explained how 
he became int erested in 
nutrition, a subj ect which he 
felt was not "exploited 
enough." He believes that 
nutritional mea ures cou ld 
greatly improve the health of 
most people. In the course of 
hi s earlier investigations he 
became interested in vitamins, 
particularly vitami n C. 

Hum ans, unlike the vast 
majority of animals, are 
unable to produce their own 
vi tamin C. In the course of 
evolution hum ans lost this 
ability and were forced to rely 
upon their environment as a 
source of vitami n C. Pauling 
feels that this has caused a 
s tate of " hypoascorbia" in us 

a ll , On the average, animals 
which produce their own 
vitamin C produce as much as 
10 grams per day per 70 
kil0r-am ' of body weighl. "r 
don t believe that human 
beings differ enough from 
animals," Pauling reasoned , 
and felt that we should take in 
equall y as much vitamin C. 
Pauling r ecom mend s 1-4 
grams of vitamin C daily, 
rat her than the recommended 
dail y a ll owa nc e of 60 
milligram s , Thi ' , Pauling 
claims, is in accordance with 
what primitive man must 
ha ve produced. He himself has 
taken 10 gram ' per day for 
many year. 

The reason ' for so much 
controversy are manifold , The 
value of megadose vitamin 
therapy is highly cri ticized by 
the m e di ca l profe s · ion. 
Pauling feel s that large doses 
of vitamin C could only do 
good , In addition, Pauling 
claims that "vitamin are 
astonishi ngl y lacking in 
toxici t y," But we mu s t add 
that t he exact biochem ica l 
functions of vitam in C are not 
well understood. It is known, 
for example, that vitamin C 
plays a n important role in t he 
produ ction of collagen, a 
cons tituent of connective 
tissue. A deficiency of vitamin 
C can lead to 'curvy, The 
majority of ob ' ervations 
made, however, s till lack 
com plete explanations. 

One of these observat ions is 
that \' itamin C potentiat es the 
Immune system. The forma-
lion of particu lar anti bodies 
has been shown to depend on 
large amount s of vitamin C in 
the bloodstream. Likewise, the

actIv Ity of macrophages 
(which help to ingest foreign 
material such as viruses and 
bacteria) is dependent upon 
the presence of vitamin C. 

The complement system. 
which marks foreign cell ' for 
destruction by lymphocytes, is 
also activated by vitamin C. A 
high concentration of a 
s pecific co mponent (called 
estera e, or CI) depends upon 
high vitamin C level s. Thi s 
has been pa~tial1y explained 
by the fact that estera 'e has 
many characte ri stics of 
coll agen. 

Other observations include 
vitamin C's antioxid ant 
behavior, which may be 
important in maintaining the 
unsaturated fatty substances 
making up cell membranes. 
Vitamin C is found to decrease 
cho le terol by aiding its 
breakdown, and it is known 
that vitamin C somehow pla ys 
a role as a general detoxifying 
agent in the li ver. Thus. 
substances such as carceno-
ge ni c hydrocarbon and 
nitrosamine are eli mina ted 
from the bloods tream. In 
addition. there is evidence 
pointing to the fact that 
v itamin C may increa e 
interferon production .

Jog 

BY KATH Y FINE 
Experts agree that exercise 

is good for t he heart. The) do 
nOI agree, however. on exact Iy 
how or why. This is a !>ubject 
of research for Colin Bloor. 
:vi .0 .. professor of pathology 
for the UCSD School of 
Medicine. It is the subject of 
hard workouts and sore 
muscles for his pigs. Pig ' were 
used because their cardiovas· 
cular and metabolic sy tem ' 
are similar 10 I hat of a human. 

Twenty slate·grey and 
essentially hairless Yucatan 
miniswine had their arteries 
surgically reduced 30 to 50 
percent of their normal size. 
Ten of the pigs were run on a 
sw ine·s ized treadmi ll . The 
other ten remained in their 
pens. 

All of the pigs developed 
collatera l or alternate arteries. 

ince the main arteries of the 
pig's hearts were clogged. a . is 
the case of a person with 
coronary artery disease. they 
formed I hese alternate 
chan nels to allow cont inuous 
blood flow to the heart. 

The jogging pigs. however. 
won the race to health. Their 
co llateral arteries were bigger. 
more numerous and carried 
more blood than the sedeni ary 
pigs. according to Bloor. This 
ex tra circulation saved 42% of 
heart ti 'sue in the exercised 
swine, and on Iy 17% in tho 'e 
unexercised. 

Th e s tud y s how s that 
exercise can benefit someone 
threatened by coronary artery 
di ·ease. Exactly how much 
exercise is needed is st ill 
unknown . 

Bloor emphas i7.ed that risks 
were sti ll involved , and anyone 
wit h serious heart disea e 
s hou ld on ly undertake an 
exercise program under strict 
s upervi sion.

ingestion of large doses of 
vitamin C, various enzymes 
are induced to convert vitamin 
C into various useful 
compounds. This, Pauling 
further contends, would not 
occur if vitamin C were not 
needed . 

Pauling, in short, wants to 
bring the potential of vitamin 
C to the attention of the public. 
Vitamin C, for example, shou ld 
be viewed "as an adjunct to 
conventional therapy." He 
does not claim that it is a 
panacea but that if usage is 
tarted early it can play an 

important part in the 
prevention of di ease.
