Students Hold Vigil to 
Mourn Recent Passings

BY    Meryl  Press  staff writer

The A.S. Women’s Commission held a candlelight vigil at UCSD to com-memorate the victims of the Isla 
Vista shooting, along with the passing 
of Revelle College student Ricky Ambriz 
and bioengineering professor Anouchka 
Mihaylova.

An estimated 1,000 people attended the 
vigil held on Monday, May 26 at 8 p.m.

On Friday, March 24, 22-year-old Elliot 
Rodger stabbed his three roommates before 
shooting down three other individuals in Isla 
Vista, a neighborhood where many UCSB 
and Santa Barbara Community College stu-
dents live. Rodger was the son of Hollywood 

director Peter Rodger and committed the 
murders because, according to his YouTube 
videos, he wished to “slaughter every single 
spoiled, stuck-up blonde slut I see inside [the 
sorority house].”

One of the organizers of the vigil, Eleanor 
Roosevelt College senior Mina Nilchian, said 
how inspiring it was to see an abundance of 
individuals taking time out of their weekend 
to join in solidarity with all the UCs and pay 
their respects to the victims.

“The event was definitely a success — 
there was a really strong sense of unity 
and strength as we lit candles and silently 
marched to Revelle Plaza,” Nilchian said. 

Cell Model 
Predicts 
Cancer 
Treatment

SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

UCSD researchers 
designed a virtual cell 
model that forecasts how 
patients will react to drugs.

BY  Natali e  Cu lhan e
Contributing Writer

Scientists at the UCSD Moores 
Cancer Center successfully designed 
a virtual cell model that predicts brain 
cancer cell responses to various drug 
treatments. The model’s algorithm 
uses the genetic and molecular infor-
mation from patient tumor cells to 
determine which drug would be most 
effective in combatting the cancer.

Researchers published results in the 
May 21 online edition of the Journal 
of Translational Medicine. Project sci-
entists spearheaded the study under 
the direction of Director of Neuro-
Oncology at Moores Cancer Center 
Dr. Santosh Kesari. The successful 
findings will further personalize can-
cer treatment, according to lead author 
Dr. Sandeep Pingle.

Currently, personalized cancer 
therapy suggests the use of “mouse 
avatars.” In this method, scientists 
implant patient tumor cells into live 
mouse subjects. Researchers then test 
various treatments on the mice to 
see which drug has the most positive 
effect. Pingle’s method, instead, virtu-
ally models human tumor cells and 
predicts an ideal treatment, without 
relying on variable results from live 
subjects.

“For every tumor, in order for treat-
ment to be effective, treatment has to 
be tailored to the specific molecular 
nature of the tumor,” Pingle said. “We 
can get that information from genom-
ics and proteomics.” 

To customize treatment, research-
ers remove a cell sample from the 
tumor of a patient and extract spe-
cific metabolic information. The team’s 
algorithm takes this data and generates 
a virtual profile of the patient’s natu-
ral, healthy cells. Researchers can then 
simulate metabolic mutations of this 
healthy model to produce virtual can-
cerous cells. Finally, the model simu-
lates various drug treatments upon 
these cells and predicts the most com-
bative drug for the patient’s specific 
cancer type.

The study published on May 21 
observed glioblastoma, a particu-
larly aggressive form of brain cancer 
with just a 50-percent survival rate 
within the first 15 months of diag-
nosis. Treatment is difficult, as each 
glioblastoma tumor has a unique cell 
composition. 

Despite this, when researchers 
compared the reactions of virtual cells 
to the actual reactions of their living 
culture cell counterparts, they found 
a 75-percent response accuracy. The 
study solely tested glioblastoma cells, 
but its algorithm can be used on any 
cancer.

“Our ultimate goal is to take this 
technology to the clinic to identify 
the best drugs for treating each indi-

TRANSPORTATION

Largest Campus Transit Center to be Constructed 
This Summer by Gilman Parking Structure Bus Stop
The San Diego Association of Governments and Metropolitan Transportation Services initiated   
and will fund the Gilman Transit Center, which will add four new bus stations on campus.

UCSD’s Strategic Campus 
Resource Initiatives announced on 
May 22 that the Gilman Transit 
Center, a proposed regional bus 
hub, will start construction this 
summer. When finished, it will be 
the largest transit center on campus 
and will include four new stations to 
improve commuting services for all 
UCSD students. 

According to a UCSD Physical 
and Community Planning report, 
the center itself will have two new 
shelters each for Superloop and 
campus loop shuttles, located at the 
current Gilman Drive stops between 
Myers Drive and Russell Lane. 

There will also be bus turnout

▶ Nobel Laureate Receives UCSD 
Chancellor’s Medal:

UCSD professor Mario Molina 
received the Chancellor’s Medal for his 
work in climate change science at the 
Seaside Forum at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography on May 12.

Guidelines for the UCSD 
Chancellor’s Medal mandate that there 
may only be three recipients yearly, 
and the award can be received by a 
couple as a single recipient. Since it was 
established in 2000, the award has only 
been presented 10 times.

UCSD Chancellor Pradeep K. 
Khosla recognized Molina for his 
award at a dinner ceremony, honoring 
him as a distinguished professor of 
chemistry and biochemistry.

“You have changed the world,” 
Khosla said. “... for us, our children 
and our grandchildren.”

Molina won a Nobel Prize 
for Chemistry in 1995 alongside F. 
Sherwood Rowland and Scripps 
Oceanography Professor Emeritus 
Paul Crutzen for proving that the use 

of chlorofluorocarbons in sprays is 
harmful to the Earth’s ozone layer.

▶ City of San Diego Will Construct 
New Bike Loop Downtown:

The City of San Diego announced 
a new seven-mile bike loop that would 
connect destinations from Balboa Park 
to the Gaslamp Quarter, as well adding 
additional bike lanes in Bankers Hill.

The loop will be completed by 
mid-June and City of San Diego 
Deputy Director of Transportation 
Engineering Operations Linda 
Marabian told UT-San Diego that the 
project would cost $70,000 in labor 
and material.

Officials emphasized that the bike 
route is for all San Diego residents and 
that the bike loop will be completed 
in alignment with an upcoming bike-
sharing program between the City of 
San Diego and DECOBIKE, a local 
bike-sharing provider.

Vigil Honored Recently Deceased UCSD Student and Professor

ASUCSD MOVES Helped Implement New Bike Racks, Lanes

Researchers Hope to Test Drug Combinations on Tumor Cell Models

areas to allow traffic flow while passen-
gers are loading, larger waiting areas 
and several other open-space improve-
ments. The San Diego Association 
of Governments and Metropolitan 
Transportation Services, who initiated 
the project with other stakeholders in 
accordance with the 2004 University 
Centers Neighborhood Planning 
Study, hope it will increase the conve-
nience and efficiency of mass transit.

“With the addition of the turn-
outs, city buses and campus shut-
tles will be able to line up in the 
turnouts, outside of the regular 
travel lanes,” Director of University 
Marketing and Communications 
Laura Margoni said. “This will keep 
vehicle traffic moving and enable 
more efficient passenger pick-up 

and drop-off for buses and shuttles. 
SANDAG is currently fund-

ing the entire project. Once com-
plete, the Gilman Transit Center 
will continue to serve all current 
bus routes and several new ones, 
including MTS, Mira Mesa Rapid, 
SuperLoop and the North County 
Transit District. 

ASUCSD MOVES worked closely 
with the planning office to further 
implement bike racks and dedicated 
bike lanes around the transit center. 

“I personally advocated for the bike 
lanes to be included in this project and 
made sure that there was increased 
bike parking to be a part of the design,” 
MOVES Director Kyle Heiskala said. “I 
worked in conjunction with the UCSD 
Physical and Community Planning 
office to get MTS and SANDAG to 
agree to these aspects of the project.”

According to a campuswide email 
from Associate Vice Chancellor Brian 
Gregory, the transit center is the first 
of several planned transportation proj-
ects that will improve campus access 
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Other projects include a new bridge 
across Interstate 5 at Gilman Drive, 
Mid-Coast Corridor Transit exten-
sions to UCSD and enhanced bicy-
cle features on the Genesee Avenue 
Bridge. 

The office of Campus Resource 
Planning Initiatives also plans to 
launch its On The Go website in June 
to provide timely updates on the proj-
ects, including estimated finish times 
and alternative bus stops during con-
struction.

“A lot of different organizations and 
individuals came together to donate 
candles, provide a sound system or 
even help spread the word.”

Another person whom the vigil 
honored is Revelle junior Ricky 
Ambriz, who was found unrespon-
sive in his apartment in the Village 
at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, May 17. 
Ambriz was transported to Scripps 
Hospital where he was pronounced 
deceased. The San Diego County 

Medical Examiner has yet to release 
any record of Ambriz’s death.

A donation page was created to 
assist the family with funeral expens-
es (tinyurl.com/rickyambriz) and had 
raised $10,275 at press time, exceed-
ing its goal of $10,000. There are four 
more days left to donate.

UCSD professor Anouchka 
Mihaylova was also honored at the 
vigil. Mihaylova was killed in a hit-
and-run incident on Saturday, May 
17 around 8:30 p.m. in the 11000 
block of Rancho Bernardo Road. 

She passed away in her husband’s 
arms.

The main organizer of the vigil, 
Revelle freshman Julia Eva-Maria 
Brown, said that the event was a 
success.

“The vigil was beautiful and prob-
ably one of the most humbling expe-
riences of my life,” Brown said. “It 
would have been a success if even 
one person came.”

vidual cancer patient,” Kesari said 
in a May 21 UCSD Health Sciences 
press release. 

Ideally, the team wants to test 
its model in clinical trials within 

the year. Meanwhile, researchers 
are pursuing the next step for the 
model. Currently, the algorithm 
only accurately predicts which 
single drug would most effectively 
combat tumor cells. 

“Single drug therapy is not very 

effective; eventually, the tumor 
develops a resistance against these 
single drugs,” Pingle said. “We want 
to test combinations.”

Sun God Festival Discussion 
Will Be Tabled for Thirty Days

Greetings, Tritons.
This week, Co-Station Managers 

of Triton Television Alexa Rocero 
and Jake Cushnir held a presentation 
to A.S. Council requesting money 
to be allocated for their budget in 
order to open more paid positions. 
Currently, each position’s stipend is 
$50 per week. Opening new positions 
would add $40 
per individual 
every week, which 
would sum up to 
$4,000 weekly.

In terms of 
future goals for Triton TV, Cushnir 
said that they are hoping for an 
hour slot to be split up into several 
different sectors.

“I’m only a sophomore, and I 
have a lot of ideas for where to take 
Triton TV,” Cushnir said. “A more 
structured environment would help 
across the board — we produce a lot 
of good results, but a lot of the times 
things don’t get done because we are 
stretching ourselves.”

A.S. Council tabled a conversation 
about amendment C1, which would 
create new class councils.

AVP Student Advocacy Ryan 
Huyler said that the proposal provides 
the council with more structure.

“It’s more relatable if you have a 
class council because people of the 
same class can identify with certain 
issues that college councils necessarily 
might not be able to,” Huyler said. “I 
think the changes are for the better.”

During question time, Council 
discussed actions following the 
Transportation Referendum, the 
current status of the Che Cafe and the 
state of the Sun God Festival 2015.

ASUCSD MOVES Director 
Kyle Heiskala talked about the 
implementation of the passed 
Transportation Referendum and 
how, due to the redesigning of the 

identification cards, there is no longer 
any room for serial numbers to be 
placed on student ID cards. Therefore, 
they are debating on whether to 
implement stickers or a transportation 
identification card.

Heiskala explained that, ideally, 
he would like to have one sticker per 
year for the transportation system; 

however, due 
to the fact that 
students pay on 
a quarterly basis, 
the San Diego 
Metropolitan 

Transit Center will center the 
payments on a quarterly rate as well. 
Currently, Heiskala is leaning toward 
the second campus card.

Campuswide Senator Brandon 
Kim explained shortly after that the 
Che Cafe is currently in a limbo status 
and will continue to operate until 
University Centers shuts it down.

“[The Che Cafe] lost its nonprofit 
status; however, they will have that 
reinstated next month,” Kim said. “For 
now, it will continue to operate in that 
space without any funding allocated 
from University Centers, and, should 
they decide that improvement is 
absolutely necessary, they will have to 
come and close it down.”

When Council touched on the 
subject of the Sun God Festival, 
A.S. President Robby Boparai said 
that all discussion of the festival has 
been halted by the university for 
30 days, and no decision regarding 
future festivals will be made until Fall 
Quarter 2014.

May the victims of the tragic Santa 
Barbara shootings rest in peace. No 
words can describe the deplorable 
actions that occurred last week, and 
I send my support and condolences 
to the family and friends of the seven 
individuals whose lives were so 
selfishly taken away from them.

Next week, Janet Napolitano will wrap up her first year of University of California 
instruction as the nine-campus sys-
tem’s 21st president. 

Back in Fall Quarter, we 
urged readers not to condemn 
Napolitano’s leadership until she 
had definitively worsened the state 
of the UC system. At the same 
time, we hoped Napolitano would 
rise to the occasion and help move 
our university forward.

As we look back on year one, we 
are fairly certain that Napolitano 
has neither moved us forward nor 
backwards. To date, Napolitano 
hasn’t made any inherently disas-
trous policy decisions. 

But a year of cautious action (or 
more often, inaction) has left us 
wondering when change will come 
to UC campuses and if Napolitano 
has a long-term agenda she hopes 
to roll out in the near future.

Aside from an early-term 
increase in scholarship funding for 
DREAM Act students, Napolitano 
hasn’t dramatically changed UC 
student life. Many of the problems 

our system faced over the past 10 
months were student focused (UC 
Student Association membership 
wars), campus-specific (Sun God 
Task Force Affairs) or pre-existing 
(balancing budgets).

The only definitive statement we 
can make regarding Napolitano is 
that she is not being accessible to 
students, hearing our grievances or 
working with us to fix them.

More specifically, she seems 
unavailable and distant to students 
who want to correspond. Uproar 
broke out at the UC Washington 
Center in the nation’s capital last week 
after Napolitano refused to meet with 
several dozen UCSD Washington 
Program students — even briefly — 
after she gave a talk nearby. 

Napolitano is so far removed 
from the student awareness that a 
UCSD Guardian roving reporter 
last quarter had a hard time finding 
a UCSD student on Library Walk 
who knew the UC president’s name; 
“Neeopolotahni” was the closest 
anyone one got.

To contrast, Napolitano’s pre-
decessor Mark Yudof was so well 

known on our campus — albeit 
because of student disdain for his 
policies — that “Layoff ‘Poo-dof ’” 
signs and banners frequented cam-
pus protests and demonstrations. 
Though Yudof was a familiar name 
on UC campuses for his oft-ill-
advised policies, our new UC head 
will need to reach out to students in 
stronger and more visibly positive 
ways to earn student support.

Napolitano’s relationship with 
students will only need to get stron-
ger since the UC system has poten-
tial issues on the horizon. Though 
UC tuition hasn’t gone up in several 
years, a $142 million gap between 
the governor’s proposed budget and 
the UC system’s requested alloca-
tion could mean bad news for stu-
dent piggy banks.

UC affiliates and supporters 
must keep their eyes on looming 
budget woes into the summer while 
Napolitano must seek out student 
allies for the next year and beyond.

With accessibility and afford-
ability of the UC System continu-
ously at risk, we need a Napolitano 
who bats for Team UC Students.

Big Brother 
Doesn’t 
Always Have 
Your Back

technically
 speaking

In today’s technology-filled world, we’re convinced to believe that our information is not safe, 
that our emails can be read and that 
everything we post online can be 
used against us. We’ve been assured 
by the NSA and the president that 
the government’s use of data collec-
tion is only out there to protect us, 
but in light of the recent UCSB trag-
edy, Big Brother was really nowhere 
to be found. 

The Isla Vista events have left 
many students upset and confused 
about how they could happen and 
what they could mean for mental 
health or gun control, but it’s not 
the time to let the government off 
the hook for a huge fault in its sys-
tem. The government has provided 
us with a false sense of security by 
ensuring us that our data is being 
collected for our own good, while 
recent events have proven to us that 
this is not the case.

The recent tragedy became even 
more disturbing after the revela-
tion  that so many clues had been 
available and overlooked. Elliot 
Rodger had uploaded 22 videos 
to his YouTube account and made 
regular posts on social media sites 
that revealed his angry and threat-
ening disposition. His videos often 
mentioned a “day of retribution,” 
while his activity on Puahate.com, 
a website for men to share advice 
on how to pick up women, was full 
of violent posts describing revenge 
against women. One post had even 
described how “satisfying” it would 
be if all the men in the world had 
died from a virus, so that Rodger 
could finally have his pick of beau-
tiful women.

There was ample time for the 
government to take action and 
legally investigate the case before 
it was too late. Weeks before the 
attack, Rodger’s parents saw sev-
eral disturbing videos and alerted 
a therapist and the police about 
their concerns for the mental health 
of their son. The Santa Barbara 
County police met with the shooter 
— who essentially fooled them dur-
ing the investigation — without 
watching the videos or requesting 
a warrant to search his apartment. 
Viewing the videos may have very 
well changed their procedure and 
even their assessment. Rodger even 
confessed in his manifesto that if 
the police had even entered his bed-
room, his entire plan would have 
been foiled immediately.

Besides the mistake made by the 
deputies, the NSA was absent in 
the Rodger case. It’s hard to believe 
that data collectors can regularly 
extract our information and web 
history to invade our privacy, yet 
they neglected to see or take action 
when a terrorist uploaded plans for 
a massacre online. It’s also upset-
ting to realize that advanced algo-
rithms can detect copyright music 
or film material to protect company 
profits but cannot ensure the safety 
of the public.

If the NSA really spends so 
much time and money sifting 
through our data, it’s only fair for us 
to feel protected, not neglected or 
exploited. This mistake was made at 
a large cost, and my heart goes out 
to the victims, their families, their 
friends and students at UCSB.

Following last weekend’s Isla Vista tragedy, students and university leadership 
should reflect together and establish new safety measures on campus. 

In the Aftermath

See UCSB, page 5

Here at the UCSD Guardian, the tragedies of the last two weeks have been difficult for us to both experience and cover. Our community is still reel-
ing from the loss of two members of our own campus, and 
the disturbing events of the massacre at Isla Vista leave us 
with even more unanswerable questions. With so many col-
leagues, friends and family mourning, recovering and suf-
fering, it is important to support UCSB, the UC system and 
one another as UCSD students.

We’re not interested in using the Isla Vista tragedy as a 
soap box for speaking on gun control, mental illness or even 
misogyny, but students need to critically analyze the shoot-
ing and see how our university and the UC system can learn 
from it.

In light of the recent deaths within our own campus, 
UCSD students pulled together to mourn both a lost stu-
dent and a professor and have even helped the family who 
lost a son pay for funeral services. On Monday, hundreds 
of students participated in a vigil outside of Geisel Library 
to commemorate the UCSB victims, UCSD student Ricky 

Ambriz and UCSD professor Anouchka Mihaylova. While 
it is clear that students care about supporting one another, 
standing in solidarity in light of tragedy is only the first step.

We need to actively support one another through this 
difficult time but also be an active community even after 
everyone has grieved. We can’t wait around crossing our fin-
gers and hoping that another massacre won’t occur; things 
will have to change. As a university, we need to become 
more prepared and educated on what to do in case of anoth-
er emergency. And as students, we need to understand our 
responsibility to be aware of our campus resources and to 
watch out for one another even after the initial shock wave 
from Isla Vista starts to fade.

The Isla Vista shooting was frightening and disturbing, 
but it showed us that our universities might be more vul-
nerable to attack and unprepared for emergencies than we 
would have thought. With a campus designed as disjointedly 
as UCSD, improving intracampus communication should 
now become a top priority. Currently, our only method of 
communication is ridiculously slow, ineffective and incon-

venient; in case of an emergency or 
crisis, we need a method that will 
spread messages to students rapidly 
and reliably.

Students must also start to take 
the initiative to avoid potentially 
dangerous situations. “See some-
thing, say something” is an easy 
phrase to throw around, but it is 
pertinent and critical for any situa-
tion in which a student’s life could 
potentially be at risk. We don’t 
expect students to suddenly change 
their majors to psychology to bet-
ter understand the complexities of 
their peers’ minds, but it is fair to 
ask students to look out for their 
friends. Students should be able to 

point their friends in the direction of 
help when they are concerned, and to 
notify campus resources when a situa-
tion seems unsafe or when the health 
of a friend appears jeopardized.

In regard to the Isla Vista case, 
it is unclear whether the shooter’s 
peers had reported the actions 
and the nature of their colleague. 
Released investigation files report 
that one of the suspect’s roommates 
had indicated some problems to his 
parents, but it remains unclear as 
to whether any concerns had been 
raised with authorities. And while 
the shooter’s family had been suspi-
cious of the shooter’s videos, even 
reporting their son to the police, 
the investigation was put to rest 
after one cursory police visit to his 

apartment. We’re unsure if multiple 
student reports could have pushed 
the case for further investigation by 
the university or the police, but we 
can only wish it did.

UCSB is only hours away from 
La Jolla, and it hits particularly 
close to home that many students 
were killed and put at risk by a 
member of their own community. 
There are many ways to address 
these recent events, but the most 
important thing that can come 
from this is actual change. All too 
often, awful events have riveted and 
shocked millions of people only to 
be forgotten. We cannot wait for 
greater tragedies to occur in our 
own neighborhoods, communities 
and campus before taking action.

Jack Johnson
Venue: RIMAC Field
Concert Date: Aug. 30

Show: 6:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $49.50 (Students: $34.50) 

Singer-songwriter Jack Johnson is the 
epitome of laid-back Hawaiian culture. 
He had it made as a professional surfer, 
but after neatly cracking his head open at 
Pipeline, he gave up going pro and picked 
up the guitar. 

Jack Johnson’s songs range from upbeat 
rock to chilled-out blues tracks, and many 
of them are about living slow, going to the 
ocean and finding someone you love. But 
somehow, his music is always fresh, pull-
ing off calm and content without ever get-

ting sappy or monotonous. Consistently 
versatile in concert, Jack Johnson switches 
off between distorted electric guitar, 
acoustic guitar and ukulele, singing lead 
vocals while his concert band backs him 
up with drums, bass and piano. Both a bro 
and a heartthrob, Jack Johnson’s music has 
a wide appeal, and we’re lucky to be able 
to rock out to his music right at UCSD.

Carnivores Tour
Venue: Sleep Train Amphitheatre
Concert Date: Sept. 16
Show: 6:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $33.00 to $251.46

Linkin Park, 30 Seconds to Mars and AFI

In one of the most anticipated alternative 
music collaborations of all time, Linkin Park 
will team up with 30 Seconds to Mars and AFI 
for the upcoming “Carnivores” tour. As leading 
artists in the rock music genre, LP and Mars 
share many fans who will be eager to get tickets 
to this tour. Supporting these bands with over 
two decades of experience is AFI, rounding out 
the high level of talent on the tour.

The concert will be held at Sleep Train 
Amphitheatre, an open air stadium, which will 

complement the perfect setting of warm San 
Diego weather to amazing music. The venue is of 
average quality, but with these high-profile bands, 
it will be more than adequate to rock out in.

All three of these bands have reputations for 
incredible, live vocals and acoustics, making this 
concert one that will be memorable.

Arctic Monkeys
Venue: Cal Coast Credit Union Open Air Amphiteatre
Concert Date: Aug. 6
Show: 7:30 p.m.
Tickets: $26.50 to $74.90

The mark of the master musician is work 
that improves with time. Arctic Monkeys is 
one of the few rock groups whose music has 
been consistently praised and loved by fans 
and critics alike, album after album.

For many fans, Arctic Monkeys’ 
suburb-punk sound defined their rebel-
lious teenage years. Sadly, the band rarely 
plays classic favorites such as “A Certain 
Romance” or “Fluorescent Adolescent,” but 
this should be no deterrent for fans who 

have wanted to see the band for a long 
time. “AM” is a fantastic album dripping 
with energy and the genre-eluding sound 
that the Arctic Monkeys are known for. A 
true fan of any of their work, old and new 
alike, should not miss the opportunity 
to see such a unique and talented group 
perform live.

Iron & wine
Venue: Humphrey’s By The Bay
Concert Date: Aug. 11
Show: 7:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $49.30 to $286.55 

Since 2002, Samuel Beam has been 
producing soft-spoken folk rock with rich 
guitar and banjo under the stage name 
Iron & Wine. His down-to-earth lyrics will 
make you feel like you’re gently moving 
through a field on a summer’s day. Even 

more somber melodies like “Cinder and 
Smoke” and “Caught in the Briars” 

are soothing and reminiscent of the 
sounds you hear in nature; this 

rhythm will ground you no matter what 
mood you’re in.

In terms of venue, with an incredible view 
of the San Diego Harbor and the magnificent 
sunset in the backdrop, Humphrey’s Concerts by 
the Bay is the perfect place to unwind from your 
busy workday and relish this summer with some 
Iron & Wine.

Passenger
Venue: House of Blues
Concert Date: Sept. 14
Show: 7:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $55.00 to $217.80

Mike Rosenberg of Passenger may not 
sport a beard as epically long as Wil-
liam Fitzsimmons’ or as frilly as Iron and 
Wine’s, but his idiosyncratic voice and wit-
ty quips are more than enough to solidify 
his status as a fellow folk-rock musician.

Although widely known for the melan-
cholic track “Let Her Go,” Passenger’s other 
songs richly blend honesty and satire. His 
lyrics range from stars and tea, to Facebook 
and clever phones (yes, that’s what he calls 
iPhones), all coupled with a British accent.

Noted for his intimate performances, 
Passenger has the ability to hush enthu-

siastic fans during slower, quieter tunes 
— every folk-rock concert-goer’s dream. 
His stage presence is carefully crafted, 
perfectly balancing moments of silence 
with hilarious anecdotes and loud sing-
alongs to engage audiences, all the while 
demanding their respect.

Mike Rosenberg’s fuzzy beard is great, 
but his sense of humor and control over 
crowds are even better.

Arcade Fire
Venue: Sleep Train Amphitheatre
Concert Date: Aug. 5

Show: 7:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $39.50 to $325.00

Indie powerhouse Arcade Fire has showed 
no sign of slowing down despite dominating 
its genre for a decade. Instead, the band has 
successfully pushed its sound in various 
directions, blending its signature art rock with 
a strange, tongue-in-cheek disco throwback for 
2013’s album “Reflektor.”

The band will bringing its new sound to 
Sleep Train Amphitheatre in August. And 
luckily, this is one of the few bands we’d 
recommend seeing at such an enormous venue. 

The “wall-of-sound” generated via its numerous 
band members creates an intimate performance 
for every audience member, despite the size of 
the crowd.

As August rolls around and the tally of 
summer days diminishes, there is no better cure 
for the coming of fall than the hypnotic beats 
and tender contemplations of Arcade Fire.

The Guardian samples the world’s cuisine in San Diego. This week: Thai.
GUARDIAN GOES GLOBAL

Newly opened Aroi Cafe 
offers a modest depiction of an 
authentic Thai restaurant. Like 
most Thai places traditionally 
presented in a low light setting, 
Aroi Cafe’s ambiance definitely 
delivers on the promised “darkness” 
but perhaps a bit too much. 
Embellished with limited Oriental 
decor, the atmosphere is slightly 
on the gloomy side rather than 
an embodiment of a genuine Thai 
experience. Making up for the 
lack of authenticity, however, Aroi 
plays placid, native Thai music 
in the background and provides 
benevolently attentive service from 
the moment you walk in until the 
moment you leave. 

Thai cuisine is known for 
bringing harmony to otherwise 
discordant flavors, a marvel to the 
connoisseur world. Aroi Cafe’s 
dishes certainly live up to this 
Thai-style expectation. Starting off 
with the light appetizer, “Chicken 
Satay,” ($9) is a surefire choice that 
tingles the taste buds with its savory 
marinated chicken contrasted 
against a delicate, sweet peanut 

sauce. In addition to this starter, 
you might consider adding “Half 
Moon,” “Summer Rolls” or “Por 
Pia Tord,” each delivering uniquely 
memorable tastes to start off the 
meal. Aroi also offers traditional 
Thai soups such as the “Tom Kha,” a 
strong mixture of soothing, creamy 
coconut milk, crisp mushrooms, 
a pungent dash of lemon and a 
plethora of fresh salads, such as the 
cucumber salad, “Crying Tiger” and 
“Papaya Salad.” 

For the main course, Aroi offers a 
variety of fulfilling entrees. Ranging 
from noodles (stir-fried and soups) 
to fried rice to curries, Aroi serves a 
fair representation of a typical Thai 
meal. They also offer customers the 
power to choose whether or not to 
add a kick of spiciness to their meal, 
ranging from a scale of one — a mild 
spike to make things interesting —  
to a hot 10 —  a worthy competitor 
to a blazing fire. If you’re looking 
for something different, the chef ’s 
specialty, “Crab Fried Rice,” is a 
noteworthy mention. With jasmine 
rice providing a lightly sweet aroma, 
chewy scallions, crisp green peas and 

carrots and, of course a good portion 
of tangy crab meat, the “Crab Fried 
Rice” stands as a definite dish to 
satiate any hunger. Other specialty 
dishes worth mentioning are the 
“Duck Curry,” “Lad Nah Noodles” 
and “Pad Ped Stir Fry.” 

At the end of the day, Aroi Cafe 
offers appetizing and filling dishes 
worthy of carrying the Thai culture’s 
name. However, considering 
the rather banal ambiance, this 
restaurant is more suited for a 
family type of meal than a typical, 

casual place to eat for college 
students. 

In short: Go for the food, not for 
the experience.

Sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean and Mission Bay is The Swell Cafe, a local family-
owned business that boasts both 
great coffee and healthy breakfast 
and brunch options that sample 
from different cultures (many menu 
items are vegetarian or gluten-
free). Contrary to what one might 
think from its name, there aren’t 
any actual views of the ocean from 
The Swell Cafe, but the coffee shop 
compensates by having a huge mural 
of the ocean that runs alongside its 
patio. The majority of the seating at 
the cafe is on the huge patio, which is 

also dog-friendly. Although the noise 
from passing traffic can be loud at 
times, it is drowned out by the music 
playing out on the patio, and on 
weekends, local artists provide live 
music for customers to enjoy.

The Swell Cafe serves earth-
conscious, dual-certified, direct-
trade coffees. This means that the 
coffee served comes directly from 
the grower and holds at least two 
earth-friendly certifications, like 
fair trade certified, USDA organic 
or Rainforest Alliance certified, 
which not only makes you feel better 
about the coffee you’re drinking 

but also gives the coffee a richer 
taste. To keep in line with its goal 
of being environmentally friendly, 
the cafe encourages patrons to get 
cups “for here” in one of the cafe’s 
mugs rather than to-go. Luckily, the 
earth-conscious tactics don’t drive 
up the price of the coffee. A double 
shot of espresso costs $2.50, and a 
cappuccino is only $2.95. However, 
the cafe’s featured drinks can be a bit 
pricier: The Monkey Mocha (banana, 
chocolate and coffee) is $4.15, and the 
Winter Island Mocha (coconut and 
white chocolate) will cost you $4.45 
for a single shot of espresso and $5.25 

for a quad shot. If you aren’t craving 
coffee, The Swell Cafe does offer tea as 
well as vegan fruit smoothies like their 
Vegan Creamsicle, which includes 
orange juice, vanilla, coconut milk 
and ice. Or, if you want something a 
little sweeter, you can try one of their 
“decadent smoothies,” which are made 
with gelato or sorbet. The Chai-Nana 
includes chai, Tahitian vanilla gelato 
and banana.

In addition to coffee, the menu 
offers a wide variety of breakfast and 
lunch meals. If you want to have some 
food with your coffee, try the “cruisin’ 
crepes.” The crepes really complement 

whatever coffee beverage you get and 
are one of the less expensive options 
on the menu, costing a mere $4. 

The staff is both friendly and 
knowledgeable and is willing to 
answer any questions you might 
have regarding the menu or the 
neighborhood. Free WiFi and 
welcoming vibes make The Swell 
Cafe the perfect place to visit after 
spending the morning at the beach 
or if you’re just looking for an 
easygoing place to study.

One of my favorite Italian words is “Ciao”. Not only is “ciao” incredibly fun and easy to say, but it’s also a multipurpose word, meaning 
both “hello” and “goodbye.” This is why I have (not-
so) cleverly entitled this column “Ciao America, Ciao 
Italy” because on June 13, I will be saying goodbye to 
the States and hello to Italy, as I depart for a year-long 
study abroad trip. This column will serve as my attempt 
to act as a cultural foreign correspondent by reporting 
on the people I meet, places I go and things I do — you 
know, the important things. 

My first experience living la dolce vita was in Italy 
at just 16 years old on a high school trip. During this 
month-long stay, I was seduced 
by a romanticized version of Italy: 
cute boys on vespas, a plethora 
of gelaterias and no drinking age 
for wine. Though these aspects of 
Italian life are very real and still enticing, I’ve grown 
up a bit since then and have realized that life in Italy 
is not always perfetto. Actually, Italy has tantissimi 
problem. For example, in Italy, there is an insane amount 
of political corruption, a huge youth unemployment 
rate and don’t even get me started on Italian rap (the 
language just wasn’t meant for rap music). Despite all 
of these problems, I still want to live there. Even though 
Italy is less than perfect and is very different from the 
U.S., I want to experience something different because 
I think that immersing yourself into another culture 
is important. I’ve realized that every country has its 
quirks and that gaining a new cultural perspective is 
worth facing all of the problems that come with living in 
another country.

Even though I am excited to experience something 
new and exciting, I’m not going to sugarcoat it — leaving 
the U.S. for a year is hard. There’s so much you have to 
do, like fill out a million applications — including a visa 
application, in which you render your passport to some 
foreign consulate office. Then, there’s the whole trying 
to fit your life into a suitcase thing, which is incredibly 
difficult for a notorious overpacker. Also, you have to 
accept the fact that Europeans don’t measure distances 
in miles or feet — they put commas where decimals 
should be ($1,50 is equivalent to $1.50), and they don’t 
wear yoga pants to places other than to yoga. Finally, you 
have to say goodbye to your friends and family, which 

is quite possibly the hardest thing of 
all. Luckily, my friends and family are 
already planning their trips to come 
visit and save me from my inevitable 
homesickness.

Though there will definitely be things I miss about 
home, mainly Mexican food, people understanding my 
weird sense of humor and Netflix, I feel like leaving now 
is important for me. I feel very comfortable in my current 
lifestyle, and I think that’s a sign that I need to go and 
do something that makes me appreciate my life here. 
Leaving the country for a year seems like a great way to 
gain some life-changing experiences in a safe way that 
doesn’t involve taking any hardcore drugs in the desert or 
cutting off all my hair. My hope with this column is that 
it encourages all of my readers to travel. I know it’s a tad 
cliche, but through traveling, you learn so much about 
yourself. If traveling is not in the cards for you right now, 
please pour yourself a glass of wine, kick back and read 
about the crazy adventures I plan to go on. Ciao for now.

Ciao United States and Ciao Italia

Masi Track roller (80’s) - Up for sale is a 56cm 
Masi track bike from the 80’s. You could say it’s 
kind of rare. It was repainted by a prior owner 
and it wasn’t a great job, so it would be a great 
candidate for restoration... or just finish it and 
ride it. The frame and fork are straight, though 
there are a few minor dings in the top tube- 
common on track bikes from the bars hitting. 
Brev Masi horizontal dropouts, recent Torelli 
headset, Selle Italia seat ( weathered) profile 
design bullhorns with brake levers, a generic 
front brake (the fork was made for a brake as 
was the rear bridge), 700c Surly wheels with 
flipflop hub and two cogs. New generic tires. All 
you need is a chain, crank, bb and pedals and 
you’re riding. Listing ID: 85751864 at ucsdguard-

coaches reached out to the uncom-
mitted high school senior. 

“They pretty much just sold 
me on the school,” Lizotte told the 
UCSD Guardian. “I wanted to come 
to a program where I felt like I could 
have an impact on the team and the 
school.”

Over the last four years, she 
has certainly had quite the impact. 
However, the beginning of her col-
legiate career began on a rather 
rough note, as she was academically 
ineligible during the first half of her 
freshman season. 

“I took it for granted how easy 
high school was, and then I came 
here and failed a class,” Lizotte said. 
“Coming back halfway through sea-

son, I felt I had a lot to prove to my 
teammates as we finished out our 
season.”

It seems the short time that she 
missed out on only motivated her 
more to succeed. The Tritons have 
won the WWPA championship 
title and qualified for the NCAA 
Championship tournament the past 
three out of four years with Lizotte and 
her fellow seniors at the heart of it all. 

“There have been a ton of memo-
ries and experiences in and out of 
the pool that I will never forget,” 
Lizotte said. “There is [a] bond I 
have with my teammates, especially 
my senior class, that I will take with 
me the rest of my life.”

Beyond the pool, Lizotte’s influ-
ence extends into student politics, 
as she has been a part of the Triton 

Athletes Council — UCSD’s united 
student-athlete voice — for the past 
three years. In her first year with 
TAC, she was involved with the 
department’s attempted Division I 
athletics referendum.

“Although we did not get the 
outcome we had hoped for, the 
department is gearing up for another 
referendum,” Lizotte said. “It really 
demonstrated the bond of this com-
munity and that the athletes and the 
athletic department is a force to be 
reckoned with.”

In regards to her own future, 
Lizotte doesn’t have to look too far. 
She will remain at UCSD through 
winter quarter to complete her degree 
in communications, and as for her 
water polo career, she has no intention 
of hanging things up just yet. 

“I am going to be working out and 
taking a shot at the senior national 
team,” Lizotte said. “And going to the 
Olympics, that’s the ultimate goal.”

As one of the top players in the 
country, an ambitious destination such 
as Rio for the 2016 Olympic games is 
undoubtedly within her reach. When 
Lizotte broke UCSD’s all-time scoring 
record earlier this season, her mark 
in the Triton record books surpassed 
none other than former Olympic sil-
ver medalist Julie Swail. 

“I am willing to try to see if that 
is a possibility for me,” Lizotte said. “I 
know I can compete with any of those 
girls, I just have to go out and prove it, 
and prove it to myself.” 

the vast majority of UCSD’s talent 
will return in 2015 and with it, the 
promise that 2014’s banner year will 
not only be repeated but improved 
upon as the team matures. Justin 
Donatella and several other under-
classmen pitchers are throwing on a 
level comparable to the best in the 
nation. Brandon Shirley, a redshirt 
freshman and breakout star late in 
the year, proved to be an offensive 
powerhouse and an invaluable asset 
in clutch situations. Troy Cruz start-
ed every game for the Tritons, both 
in the regular and postseason and, 
as only a sophomore, has cemented 
a position on the team as a standout 
player on the mound, on the field 
and at bat. 

Along with returning talent, 
UCSD also has plans to completely 
renovate Triton Ballpark and estab-
lish updated, polished facilities. This 
change will undoubtedly advance 
the school’s recruiting efforts, and 
by my prediction, the Tritons will 
be competing for Division II NCAA 
Championships before the incoming 
freshman class of 2018 graduates.

There is no doubt that those 
leaving this year have left an indel-
ible mark on the program. However, 
with so many young, talented play-
ers rising to fill the ranks of those 
departing and new facilities to ele-
vate UCSD’s national recognition, 
the 2015 season stands to be yet 
another year for the record books. 
I wish all those involved with the 
program a healthy and productive 
offseason and look to the Tritons 
retaking the field next year with 
great anticipation.

Lizotte’s Legacy

Bright 
Future Lies 
Ahead for 
Baseball

It was hard not to feel slightly 
robbed as I watched the Chico State 
players rally around one another 
after beating the Tritons in the 
NCAA West Regionals just a couple 
of weeks ago. After a career year 
for more than a handful of Tritons, 
a 38–16 record and the school’s 
sixth California Collegiate Athletic 
Association Championship, I still 
think the 2014 baseball season came 
to a close too soon.

Head coach Eric Newman and 
his staff organized their talent to 
win close, contentious games, time 
and time again. The staff had an 
uncanny ability to get players to buy 
into game strategies over the course 
of the season. If I had to attribute the 
synergy of the squad late in the sea-
son to one singular action, I would 
have to say it would be the efforts of 
the coaching staff and their pursuit 
of player and team development. 

To say that our graduating 
seniors will be missed on the field 
would be an understatement. Seniors 
Nick La Face and Justin Rahn had 
incredible years, evidenced by their 
recent honors from the American 
Baseball Coaches Association. The 
two seniors always seemed to get 
Triton bats going when they were 
most needed and were season-long 
cornerstones of the team’s offensive 
effort. They will leave large holes 
that may prove difficult to fill. Blake 
Fassler, Spencer Frazier, David Hart, 
Garrett Tuck and Scott Zeman also 
pitched their last innings as Tritons 
and their leadership both on and off 
the field will be greatly missed. 

However, in spite of the bitter end 
and the exit of these valuable players, 
the Tritons’ potential in the coming 
years excites me. A couple months 
earlier, as momentum built toward 
the end of the season, I combed over 
statistics and watched the team grow 
and realize its full potential. While 
the team graduated key seniors,

PLAYER SPOTLIGHT Sarah Lizotte

W ith major records shattered and heaps of awards earned throughout an illustrious collegiate career, senior utility of the UCSD women’s water polo team Sarah Lizotte 
has certainly left her mark on the Triton program she has led 
for the past four years. 

The Tritons recently wrapped up their 2014 campaign, 
concluding the season with a 27–13 record and finishing 
eighth overall at the NCAA Championships with Lizotte at the 
head. She led in scoring in her fourth and final season with 84 
goals and tying with teammate junior attacker Jolene Guiliana 
for assists with 51 apiece. The team suffered a slightly bitter 
end, going 0–3 in the final tournament against three of the 
nation’s top eight squads. 

However, the Riverside native exits her career far from 
empty-handed; the senior holds a mile-long list of accolades 
and unforgettable experiences in the Triton uniform. She was 
the Western Water Polo Association Player of the Year in 2013 
and 2014 and the 2012–13 UCSD Athlete of the Year; her 26 
total goals in three NCAA appearances just barely trails the 

all-time record of 30 goals set by Stanford University’s senior 
driver Lauren Silver; and she broke UCSD’s all-time career 
records for goals (313), attempts (557) and assists (171).

Lizotte’s slew of accomplishments and elite skills in the 
water stand firmly atop a dedication to the sport she has 
immersed herself in since childhood. She began her career 
at five years old, when she started swimming competitively, 
before taking up water polo when her swim team added the 
sport to its program. 

Lizotte attended Riverside-Poly High School (2006–09) 
and played four years of varsity water polo, winning three con-
secutive conference and California Interscholastic Federation 
championships. 

By her senior year, Lizotte was a highly sought-after recruit, 
receiving numerous offers from top Division-I programs. Yet, 
amid all the top-tier university hoopla, Lizotte was accepted to 
UCSD based purely on academic merit. Soon after, the Triton
