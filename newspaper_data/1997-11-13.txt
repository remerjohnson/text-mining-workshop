TritonPlul Advertisement 
Is Cheap and Demeaning 

Turning over your new TritonPlus card reveals the 
familiar blue globe of AT&T advertising a "service" 
that allows students to use the TritonPlus card as a 
Ma Bell calling card. 

The campus identification card is a powerful sym-
bol of UCSD as an academic institution. Decorated 
with UCSD's most recognizable structure, Geisel 
Library, the card represents the university_ Moreover, 
every student, staff and faculty member carries one 
for identification purposes, to borrow books and to 
use as an on-campus debit card. 

The presence of the AT&T logo (or any other cor-
porate sponsor's logo, for that maHer) on the 1.0. 
card cheapens our university. Furthermore, its pres-
ence is offensive because not all students wish to 
patronize AT&T, yet all are forced to be the compa-
ny's walking billboards. 

We recognize that the high use of the 1.0. card 
makes it a prime location for advertising, but placing 
an ad on our 1.0. cards solely for the purpose of 
financial gain is a sketchy fundraising strategy at 
best. 

Our I.D. cards are not commercials and must be 
clear of sponsors. 

Guardian Cannot Change 
Without Your Input 

Everywhere you go, you hear people bashing thc

out of touch with the campus. We wouldlt't know 
news if it came up and bit us in the notebook. 

So what? 
For the last couple of days, our editor in chief has 

sat with an enormous Guardiall sign in the Price 
Center Plaza. Where were you? Other than a couple 
of visiting high school students and a veteran who 
went through Marine boot camp at UCSD when it 
was still Camp Matthews, not onl.! person stopped by. 

We do the best Wl.! can, but Wl.! can't do this with-
out you. We need to know what you think of us . Give 
us your feedback - positive or negative, constructive 
or not , we'll take it all. Either swing hy the'office and 
tell us. give us a call or writc a letter to the editor.

you tell us. 

Ryan Olson, one of ollr news editors, will be at the 
Price Center Plaza' today from II: 15 a.m. to 12:]0

EQUALITY REDEFINED IN THE 
WAKE OF PROPOSITION 209 

COMMENTARY: An increasing number of states are refusing to put up with the 
ridiculous legal challenges posed by politicians and other opponents of Prop. 209 

C H R I 5 
SCHREIBER 
My Biased Opinion 

The racial tide has finally turned. 
While not all pol iticians, and not even 
all judges, have come to grip~ with the 
new applu;atlon of fairness, it is plain 
that the Inexorahle advance of the truth 
and Prop. 209 continues without their 
assent. For the moment . at least. jus-
tice has prevailed. and its ultimate vic-
tory seem~ assured. 

The refusal of the United States 
Supreme oun to rc\ ICW th e 9th 
Circllit Court 01 Appeals ' strongly 
worded ruling that Propo~ill()n 209 -
the alirornla ~ ta!e propo~iti()n \I hich 
outlaw\ ,ta te- and local - government 
racial quotas - is conslilutionni is jus-
tice 's late~t victory. 

The 5th Circuit's opinion from last 
year's Hopwood case stated that public 
universities could not employ quotas, 
given the more palatable name "affir-
mative action." to ,\ltnin what their 
administrators felt was proper racial 
diversity. 

- Additionally, the Supreme Court 's 
1995 ruling in Adarand demanded that 
federal "afli rmative-ac tion" programs 
must be held to strict scrutiny. 

When one considers these three 
cases, one cannot help but notice a dis -
tinct trend. It becomes apparent that 
the highest courts in the land are lead-

i~g the effort to make sure that people 
are judged on their individual merits. 

However, even with all the momen-
tum toward fairness, do not think that 
racial-bias proponents are going softly 
into that good nighl. 

Led by the recalcitrant Clinton 
Administration, the quota queens and 

The liberals will likely 
do IiHle to change 
anything unless 
forced by further 
lawsuits or by 
gubernatorial 
Influence. However, 
they pose a much 
smaller threat than do 
the Clinton 
bureaucrats. 
kings of the liberal lert arc howling 
about "disparate impacl." Those with 
any power are doing their best imper-
sonations of former Alabama 
Governor George Wallace in advocat : 
ing or trying to force non-compliance 
with the court rulings and the will of 
Ihe people as expres~ed in constitu-
tional Proposition 209. 

The mayor of San Francisco, Willie 
Brown, is the most prominent of Lhe 
many local politicians who have 
threatened to refuse to comply with 
Proposition 209. The liberals will like-
Iy do little LO change anything unless 
forced to by funher lawsuits or by 
gubernatorial influence. 

However, they pose a much small-
er threat than do the Clinton bureau-
craLs. 

The U.S. Department of 
Education's Assistant Secretary for 
Civil Right s, Norma Cantu, a longtime 
foe of individual rights, tried to use the 
musc le of the executive branch to 
force the Uni versi ty of Texas to refuse 
to comply with the 5th Circuit's 
Hopwood decision . She also made 

threa t ~ ag,linst the University of 
California after the UC Regents voted 
to end racial quota programs. 

Canlu only backed down when the 
ncgati vc puhlicity ~hl.: genl.:rated made 
thing~ uncomfortable for her superi-
ors. It would not stretch one's concep-
tion of reality too far, though , to spec-
ulate that she i~ looking for other way~ 
to ~ty mie tllO~e universities, as \~e ll as 
an y other~ who dare to assume each 
individual should be judged according 
to hi~ own record. 

More legal challenges arc waiting 
in the wings, and should provide inter-
esti ng debates as they become more 
widely known . In one case, dealing 
with racial preferences in university 
admissions, the Center for Individual 
Rights filed a casc challenging set-
asides at the University of 
Washington. 

Another education-related case on 
court dockets involves a young white 
girl excluded from a federally funded 
science program because her skin 
lacked suflicient melanin content. 

The most intriguing case, however, 
involves an African-American gradu-
ate student suing the Lraditionally all-
black Alabama State University 
because he did not qualify for a schol-
arship that is offered Lo whiLe students. 
The intention of the scholarship was to 
"diversify" Lhe student body.

Thursday, November 13, 1997 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 

WRITER'S CLAIM RIDICULOUS i ~? EspressoNet Editor: Chris Schreiber's commentary, 
"Tree-Huggers Forget Practical 
Impact of Laws" (OCI. 3D, 1997) is 
a horribly misleading view of envi-
ronmentalism. 

Surely no one would disagree 
with Chris ' statemcnt that "We 
need to take a long hard look at 
policies thut ask w, to sacrili ce any 
or our freedom~ for Ihc 'coml1lon 
good.'" 

Although he acknowledgc~ the 
right of the individual to dmc thl.: 
car of his choice. he ignores my 
personal freedom to live without 
the consequences of global warm-
ing - the fcar thaI our coastal 
cities will be nooded , that our mid-
wntinental agricultural regions 
will not hc plagued wi th drought 
(leading to luwer foud production 
and pw,sible faminc ) and that enor-
mous populations of the world's 
people will not have to migratc in 
ordcr to live in milder climatcs 
(t hus leading to conllicts betwcen 
peoples and war). 

The intentions of environmen-
talists such as Illyself arc not 
"warm and luZlY" as Chris claims 
- I am moved by issucs that arc 
literally a quesllon of life or death 
for the world we live in . 

FurLhermore, the claims regard-
ing CFCs are ridiculous. He says 
that poor and minority children wi tl 
die hecause CFC~ arc not allowed 
in asthma inhalers, ignoring the 
very market force s 111 which he 
dearly puts so much I:lIth. 

As neccsslly i\ the mother of 
invention . a reduction in the avai l-
ahility of cheap inhalers will tead 
to an untapped market and ~ome 
inlelligent capitali\t ~omewhere 
will cerrainly invent a cheap, envi-
ronmentally safe inhaler - espe-
cially since a huge market wi II 
exist as the rate of asthma in chil-
dren skyrockets due to air pollution 
in our communities. If a solution 
were not found I am sure it would 
become an issue of dcbate and an 
exception in policy would he made. 

Either way, his argument 
ignores Lhe serious consequences 
of the ozone destruction. which 
include increased skin cancer rates 
in humans and adverse effects on 
phytoplankton , resulting in 
decreased primary productivity in

Individual Choice 
Not Always Efficient 
Editor: 

In the OI:l. 30 issue of the 
Gllardiu", Chris Schreiber main-
tains that environmentalists take 
actions that are harmful to sOl:iety 
because they arc "loathe to exam-
ine" what the consequcnces of their 
actions will be. 

Schreiber atso states that the 
choice made by an "individual i~ 
always more efficient" than that 
made by regu lati ng agencies, con-
cluding that it IS more efficient for 
society if everyone who wants a 
sport-utility vehic le owns one. 

Assuming that Schreiber sees 
individual choice leading 10 the 
most efficient social outcome by 
laisse:-faire Ipgic. he has made a 
significant error. For this logic 10 
hold, some assumptions must be 
met , onl! of which is that goods 
bear their true cost to society. 

In the casc of fossi l fuel" thiS 
assumrtion i~ not mel. There arc 
costs associated with the produl: -
tion of gasoline that are not reflect-
l!d in the pri ce that you pay at the 
pump. 

For t:xamplc, our federal gov-
ernment ~uhsidiles oil exploration 
projects, Icading to the over-wn-
,umption of gasoline at the l!xpcnse 
of the American taxpayer. This i, 
nOI an efticicnt outcome, and in 
fact tho,e peorle that usc a lot of 
ga~()line arc doing ,0 at thl! 
expense of the re~1 of us. It ~eelm 
that Mr. Schreiber was " loathe to 
examine" the facts.

Support Needed for 
Outreach Proposal 
Editor: 

As thc 1997-9X Council of the 
Graduate Student ASSOCiation 
(GSA ), which repn:sents mml! than 
3,000 graduate Mulients, we arc 
writing to vo ice our support of the 
Rep0l1 or the UC 'D Task Force on 
K- 12 Outreach. 

The GSA Council unanimously 
fe..:l~ that thi s proposal. which will 
I:omc to a vote in the Academic 
Scnate on (lV. 25 . repre,ent~ an 
opportunity for UCSD to serve as a 
modet for tile rest of till! UC 'Y'-
tem in cnm:hing the secondary

munity. 

The proposal would be a great 
boon to the public image of the uni -
versity, and could prove to be an 
extremely effective toot for recruit -
ing talented students who might 
otherwise he overlooked. 

Although UCSD has had a long 
and suhstantial commitment 10 a 
divcrse student body, there is room 
for the curren t programs to be Illore

Alan Bersin, the United State~

"The border i, an extraordinary

Bersin also said that through his

"NAFTA has marginal rele-

"I would like 10 propose to 
you that the road [to peace] is one 
of spi rituality, which basically 
comes down to a road of under-

UNION: 
Only one third of 
workers voted 
Continued frOlll ..... 1 
tation received 16 percent. About 
12,000 clerical workers abstained 
from voting. 

The announcement was made 
last Wednesday after a month of 
voting by clerical workers 
statewide. Lass said the election 
was monitored by the state Public 
Employment Relations Board. 

PERB mailed a ballot to each 
eligible voter on Oct. 6, and ballots 
returned to PERB by Nov. 3 were 
counted. PERB announced the 
results on Nov. 5. 

In order to hold the election, 
C.U.E. had to gather signatures 
from at least 30 percent of the uni -
versi ty 'S clerical workers. Lass said 
that the union gathered 8,500 sig-
natures - 3,000 more than needed. 

Lass said that the primary dif-
ference between C.U .E. and 
AFSCME is that C.U.E. is more 
oriented toward issues that concern 
university employce~ . 

AFSCME rcpresents a wide 
range of non-university, non-cleri-
cal employecs as well. 

"The primary thing is that it is an 
employee-owned and operated 
union," Lass said. "We are all volun-
teers who have organized this union, 
and all or us running the union arc 
clerical workers in the UC system so 
we know best what the issues arc 
and concerns arc and how best to 
represent clerical employces." 

Lass said that C. U.E. was 
formed two years ago by former 
AFSCME activists and leaders. 

lennifer Roth, a C.U.E. represen-
tative at UCSD, said the union will 
hold a statewide meeting this week-
end in Berkeley. A regional meeting 
in Los Angeles is in the works. 

AFSCME staff representative 
Donna Brenneis said she wishes 
the new union success, but added 
that she doubts it will be able to 
achieve its objectives. 

"[ think that people need to get 
what they want," Brenneis said. 
'The aftermath of that one is that 
be careful what you ask for because 
you might just get it." 

Historically, Brenneis said that 
AFSCME had a difficult time try-
ing to fight apathy among clerical 
employees. In AFSCME's heyday, 
only 7 percent of UC clerical 
cmployees belonged to the union. 

AFSCME and UC had recently 
negotiated a contract for clerical 
employees. That contract, which 
lapses in June 199 , provides ror a 2 
percent cost-of-living salary increase. 

UCSD Labor Relations Director 
Michael Melman said the uni versity 
will negotiate with the new union. 

''The clerica l employees that 
voted havc made a dctermination 
that C.U.E. wi ll be their exclusive 
representativc," Melman said. 
"Obviously, the university is oblig-
ated to sit down and to negot iate a 
col lect i ve-bargaining agreement 
with them, and that 's what the uni -
versi ty will procecd to do." 

Melman said that the clerical 
workers have benefited under the 
current terms of agreement. 

"Overall , when you compare 
thcm to other similarly-s ituated 
workers in the community, they 
have very good conditions of 
employment," he said.

In Ihe '>ame time period, the num-

Hedrick said thai because Ihe

forced 10 rely upon temporary lec-

such as increasing lab and course

"All the Ihings don ' t conlribute

The changes have been met 
with crilicism from students.

"My biggest concerns were just 
the pure number of students Ihat 
are being affected," said A.S . 
Commissioner of Academic 
Affairs David Freeman. "Their 
plans to reduce the number of biol-
ogy majors from 4,000 to 2,700 is 
going 10 affect a 101 of students. 

Thursday, November 13, 1997 

"Our responsibility is to try to 
represent the students and to deler-

. mine whal is best for them, " 
Freeman continued. "Maybe il was 
besl 10 reduce il because the slu-
denls in the major righl now aren't 
gelling Ihe resources Ihey should 
be, but al the same time a 101 of 
people wanlto major in biology." 

Although Ihey are not directly 
affected by Ihe changes, current 
biology majors have bolh crili -
cized and prai sed the plan . Some 
see it a necessary improvement 
while olhers think il will creale 
problems wilhin Ihe depanmenl. 

"There are 100 many bio logy 
majors a~ it is," ~aid seni or biolo-
gy major Josh Griggs. "The clas~­
es arc huge; 300 Is tudentsj is way 
100 many for a class. Somclhing 
had 10 be done. I don't know iflhis 

i ~ Ihe besl way, Ihough." 
" II 's jusl goi ng 10 make more 

slress for sludenls. Biology majors 
are OUI of cOnlrol anyways," said 
sophomore biology major Sumila 
Adhya. "The COmpetilion is going 
to be more sli IT and there's goi ng 
10 be more pressure . II 's bad 
because it 's going to add stress." 

Because of sludenl apprehen-
sion toward Ihe plan , Hedrick said 
Ihe changes will be closely moni -
lored to ensure the program works 
effectively. In Ihe meantime, 
Hedrick said he hopes thallhe plan 
will yield the anticipaled results . 

"The whole poinl of Ihis is 10 
make Ihe undergraduate experi-
ence more intellectually enriching 
for the siudenls," Hedrick said. 
''This is an e)(perimenLaI science, 
and the nalure of it is 10 engage in 
experimenls. In order 10 provide a 
really high quality educalion, we 
have 10 be able 10 put sludenls into 
the laboralory selling, and Ihat 's 
very diffi cull wilh so many stu -
dents."

when Jim and Ingrid Croce moved from 
Philadelphia to downtown San Diego. One 
month later Jim. who had just received four 
gold alhums, died in a plane crash following 
a concert in Nachitoches, La. 

Soon after his tragic death. life dealt 
Ingrid anolher heavy blow. A series of vocal 
chord operalions left her unable to sing. 
Ingrid \ career as songw riler, singer and 
recording ariisl was fini shed. 

Taking a friend's advice. Croce opened 
her lir~ l ~ mall re~laurant ~erv lllg homemade 

hlintzes, huge "poppers" (muffins) and other 
lIiainSlays to the San Diego communit y. 

Within no II m~, her reMaurant and cater-
ing business outgrew the smali kitchell she 
rented for Just I H cent · per square foot. Ju .,t 
as her Ica~e wa. about to cnd. a rriend tipped 
her off on a vacancy in tile Historic Keallng

Croce compares her management style to 
an Irish jig she choreographed when she was 
just 7 years old. 

"I know in my heart that I don 't really 
know how the jig goes," she said. "But here

cooks, servers and musicians too and I just 
keep dancing it anyway."

Righteous Babe: Sold Oul Not Sell Out 
Ani DiFranco draws loyal fans at Spreckles' Theatre 

By Jennifer Feldman 
Guardian Reporter 

It has been a long lime , ince San 
Diego has heard an ything as fresh 
and powerful as folk -punk singer 
Ani DiFranco. Her performance 
last Frid:!y at Sprcckles Theatre 
i'm\'~d her to be a musical genius 
wilh unmatched stage presence . 

For her passionale San Diego 
rans, t hc walt could not have heen

However the crowd reacted, Ihere 
was no douht that everyone in 
attendance wou Id have agreed that 
no om: can make musi c like 
DiFram;o. 

Di Franco combines in hl'r,cif a

NOt 100 many people can get 

away with thi s inconsistency, but as 
DiFranco eloquently explains in 
songs li~ c " In or Out," it is every-
one's ri ght to he this way. 

When DiFranco sang "Fuck you 
and your unlouchable face. fuck 
you for cxisting In the firsl place," 
theme, of se lf-rdiance and of her 
own hody r() litl c~ ran rampant. 

Difranco was born in Burralo.

one can tell at her shows that her

However, when it comes to sexual 
orientation, Ani DiFranco reruses 
to be pinned down . One day she 
may feel like being a lesbian, while 
on olher days she may decide to 

DI Franco's l1lu~ ic is full of ener-

ung lalllorou ~. hlue-collar portrayal 
of the human condition to which all 
men and wumen can truly identify. 
It is no wonder DiFranco is so pop-

Verhoeven's '~tarship Troopers' Is Just "Another Bug Hunt 
Not even state-of-the-art, cutting-edge. special effects are able to save this film 

By Walt DIckinson 
Senior Staff Writer 

A long time from now. in a 
galaxy far, far away, there wi II be a 
race of creatures bent on taking 
over the universe. Earth will 
respond to their a!lacks by bringing 
Ihe hallie to the bugs and attacking 
them on their own turf. 

It ', an excel lent premise, a 
ga lactic war wi th the fat e of 
humanity hanging in the ha lance. 
However, "Star~hip Trooper," 
trai Is off into sci-Ii drivel with its 
mindless violence and sexy, shal -
low acting. 

Over the past 20 years, films 
like "S tar Wars." "Aliens" and 
"First Contact" have established a 
genre buill on elements of both sci-
ence fiction and action movies, 
produci ng some of the highest 
grossing films of all time. 

''Troopers'' could have been the

impression that the film had the 
potential to rally its peers. 

"Troopers" has all the ingredi-

First, there's the visually stunning 
enemy - large, scary, computer-

act like g-foot spiders on crack . 
Some of the bugs crawl, some ny,

ly searching for something to 
shoot. 

However, all the special effects,

AFI 
Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes 

--
-***. 

Northern California's East Bay 
area is best known for breaking 
punk bands such as Green Day, 
Rancid and Crimpshine. API fol-
low this tradition with their new 
release, Shut Your Mouth and Open 
Your Eyes. 

AFl's previous releases, AnJ'Wer 
That and Stay Fashionable and 
Very Proud oj Ya, were under-
ground favorite~, hut Shill allempl, 
10 make AFI a hou~ehold name. 

The album i~ a fantaslic mix of 
fury and energy tempered wilh 
melodic interlude~ and clean 11l1l~i · 
clanship. 

The album blasts out of the box 
with "Keeping Out of Direct 
Sunlight," a bliMering 45-second 
romp that careens inlo "Three 
Reasons." 

Lead si nger Davey Havok 
spews forth voca ls Ihal shift from 
harmonic 10 growling over the 
Ihick soup of staccalo guitar. 

The rhythm sect ion of drummer 
Adam Carson and bassisl Hunler 
Burgan lays down a tighl , Ihunder-
ing backbone. 

The album also features the 
same gang-style background vocals 
on shout-along choruse that AFI is 
known for. 

While their previous efforts 

leaned more towards the melodic 
style of punk, AFltake on a sound 
reminiscent of Minor Threat on 
Shut. The lyrics are still vintage 
API, tackling issues of personal 
disdain and stressing positivity and 
self·empowerment. 

The majority of Shut Your 
Mouth and Open Your Eyes deliv· 
ers what AFJ do best: a healthy 
dose of fast, powerful , head·bob· 
bing punk rock. 

However, "Third Season" 
breaks up the sonic assault with a 
deflating lull. 

With Shut Your Mouth and 
Open Your Eyes, AFI establish 
themselves as a force 10 be reck-
oned with, and promise more greal 
punk rock 10 come in Ihe future.

***'** 

If anyone wa, primed for a solo 
project in the rap industry, Mase 
would be the top candidale. Mase 
made several guest appearances on 
numerous hit si ngles, and turned 
everything he touched into gold. 

Wilh the help of world· famous 
producer Scan "Puffy" Combs and 
Deric "D· DOl" Angelettie, Mase 
shows thaI he can ha(;k il on his 
own wilh his firsl solo release, 
Harlem World. 

Mase demonstrates in this 
release his ability to produce plat-
inum·caliber tracks complete with 
infectious beals and superb lyrical 
skills. Mase remains true to the Bad 
Boy Entertainment philosophy of 
hip-hop, which is 10 provide audi-
ences with songs to which they can 
dance. 

Songs like dFeel So Good" and 
"00 You Wanna Get S?" are perfect 
examples of Bad Boy groove tunes 
under this philosophy. 

Mase breaks away from the 
commercialized brand of hip·hop, 
and comes wilh a more hardcore 
flavor on "Niggaz Wanna Act" fea· 
turing Busta Rhymes and "24 Hrs. 
To Live" fealuring The Lox, Black 
Rob and DMX. 

Mase also addresses all the 
"playa haters" and Bad Boy cri ti cs 
throughout lIarlem World. 
However, one Ira(;k stands OU I 
above Ihe rcst in addressing thi s 
negativity; Ma~e nexes his R&B 
crooning sk i II ~ in an entertaini ng 
off·key rendilion of the old song 
"Jealous Girl ," retitled "Jealous 
Guy." 

Thi~ alhum i~ extremely light 
and plca~ing to Ihe ca r~. fororn the 

lir~t track to the last, Mase has 
lined up ,,0 album with many hil 
si ngles waiting to he released.

OPENS NOVEMBER 14TH EVERYWHEREI 

Mood Twang, casts a spell of light, 
electronic pop over the listener, and 
fills out lhe songs with ambient 
drones. 

Likened to Stereolab and 
Orange Cake Mix (which is 
released by O'Neal's homegrown 
Fuzzy Box Records), the band has 
garnered more than its share of 
glowing comparisons. 

Cumulus Mood Twang 's song 
titles alone, including "Pial form 
Cloud," "Rain Boa Bye" and 
"Icicles and Clipboards" convey its 
ethereal qualities. 

Flowchart also drop in plenty of 
hreathy vocals and osci llator-pro· 
duced dance grooves. CUlllulus 
Mood Twang's opening Irack, 
"Envelopment Continuum" fea-
tures a jogging disco beal, while 
Ihe nexl songs follow up with more 
cheesy vocals and eternal drones . 

The humor in the obvious, tacky 
ae~thetic of the album is evident, 
but never attain\ the full comical 
glory of other such self-effacing 
pop acts like the Genlle People. 

Nevertheles~ , some of 
Flowcharl'~ hypnotic, orchewal 
,amples - which are altered and 
repealed through different pans of 
the album - coupled with stellar 
dance beats make Cumulus Mood 
Twang worthy of a few good lis· 
tens, particularly for those of the 
ambient variety.

.*.* 

Emotional lyrics and a passion 
for the cnvironmenl characterize 
NorthSouthEastWest, the new 
release from the San Diego-based 

melodic folk band Dandelion Wine. 
Comprised of Kris Skaie on 

vocals and percussion and Steve 
Schroeder on guitar, mandolin and 
vocals, the duo's talent lies in its 
ability to express "the rush of the 
world around them" without 
sounding cliched. 

Long verses of fresh and gen· 
uine lines pour fonh like poetry. 
The narrative lyrics reveal the 
group's passion for songwriting. 

Skaie's voice is warm and 
angelic. Her singing, mixed with 
Schroeder's back-up vocals and the 
rugged strum of the acoustic guitar, 
is inviting. 

Deeply introspective, this sensi· 
tive oUllook represents the group's 
dedication to environmental preser-
valion. Dandelion Wine are donat· 
ing a ponion of the profits from 
NorthSouthEaslWesl to the Sierra 
Cluh. 

As for the hand's name, the dan-
delion ha a special significance. 

"You hlow on a dandelion and 
make a wish ," Schroeder said, 
"wilh il you always have hope Ihat 
your dreams will come true." 

Even for the cyni cal, 
NorlhSolllhEaSIWest provides an 
emotiona l ride and a "dandy" relief 
from the ~tark realities of everyday 
life.

SCUD: 
Fun from one page 
to the next 
ContInued from page 15 
are are a bunch of guys dressed up 
in these day-glow spandex costumes 
with bird wings in their hats and 
capes and stuff. All they do is sit and 
complain and talk. Anct talk while 
they're lighling. And pose. It's jusl 
tons of tons of posing and complain· 
ing. and I just got sick of it. 

So with that frustration in mind, 
I got out a pad of paper, sat down at 
my kitchen table and just staned 
drawing . I decided to make a char-
acter who is very. very si mple. 
There's no history, nothing you need 
to know about the character to enjoy 
him. You ju~t put your money in the 
machine, he jumps out and it 's fun 
from page one 10 page 27. 

That's the first issue of SCI/d. 
So, il\ a very simple issue. II 's 
everything you need. The two char-
acters talk, but they don't talk 
while they're fighting . Therc\, no 
time to talk when you're in a light , 
especially In a gun light1 There\ 
no lime. 

I'm also a big fan of animalion 
and film, so I try to have a story· 
board qualily to my an and Illy ~to· 
rytelling in comic books. 

I do things, also. like adding 
suggested voice talent and a sound· 
track. So on page two, you ,hould 
be listening to the BUllhole Surfer~. 
On page live. you should he listen· 
Ing 10 Devo. On page ~ix , you 
,hould he Iislening to BjorJ.. , or 
whatever. 

I think comic hooks have got 
this rap thaI everything i, very 
'\uperhcro," and it ' ~ pretty much 
true. I mean, the market i, 99 per· 
ccnt lIuperhcroes, which is sad 
because comic books arc Just 
anolher mel hod of slorytelling . 
When somebody say.,. "I don ' t like 
comic boob," to me, that" like 
saying. "I don't like movies, I don't 
like TV, I don't like reading 
booh." I think that 's a very hroad 
statement to say. 

But, if you go 10 the indepen. 
dents like us, the guys who are jUM 
trying to do somelhing good and 
compete, I wou ld suggest to any-
hody who says "I hate cOlllic 
booh." to try our book OUI. I 
would ,a) thaI 70 percent of Ihe 
people who read our book hate 
COITIIC b()()k~. 

How Ion& have you been 
into the whole 
animationlf ilm ma king 
scene? 

Forever. Televi~ion was my 
bt:,t friend when I wa~ a kid and 
movit:~ wt:re , uch J grt:at e,capc 
for mc. I grew up with "Star War~" 
and "Raid..:r, of lht: Lost Ark ." 
Those IIlm~ cnt:rgi,,:d mt: like a 
drug, and I was constant Iy draw· 
ing. If it wasn't for them, I proha · 
bly wou Idn 't be the art i~t and sto· 
ryteller that I am today. So, I've 
been obsesscd with directors and 
filmmak ers way mure than other 
artists. 

I've been inspired by other 
artists, but I would have to say that 
my "directing" style of making 
comic books is really influenced by 
film directors like Sam Raimi. 
Robert Rodriguel, Quentin 
Tarentino, John Woo, Ringo Lam, 
Lucas, Speilberg , Hitchcock, 
Robert Zemeckis, Tim Burton, all 
of those guys. Those arc my rock 
stars. Those are the people I would 
just give up everything to work 
with, and those are the people I 
owe my life to.

That 's y.hy I dedicate eve ry 
i s ~ue 10 onc of them. Every I s~ue 
comes up, I try to give back somc-
thing they gave me. I'm positive 
they haven ' t seen it, but just so it's 
written down on paper that there 
are element~ in this issue that have 
really inspired me by these peoplc. 

So, the film thing is the greatest 
influence. Japanese ani me, too. 
I'm a big fan of Ihe maturity and 
the design sense Ihal Ihe Japanese 
cullurc pours inlo their animation 
art . I think that's just such a greal, 
greal thing, and it jusl makes me 
angry Ihal a counlry like America, 
Ihal is supposed 10 be the entcr-
tainmenl capital of the world, still 
has this backwards opinion of ani-
mation and comic books. 
Rumor ... it that Oliver 
Stone miaht be directing 
the moyie .tNMIt the comic 
book. I, that true? 

He won ' t be directing , he ' ll be 
producing. Well, I don't know. I 
was hoping he was going to, bUI 
he 's more "Nixon" or "U-Turn." 

wee 

who 

How did Oliver Stone actu· 
ally get interested in your 
book to begin with? 

Well. he has a company culled 
Illusion; what they do is Ihey go 
around and secure properties 01 

~c ripts and books, and now c.:omic 
books because they ' re now a 
great vehicle for making films . 
We were making waves in the 
independent scene for being very 
clever and very different, so we 
set up a meeting with them, 
pitched them the idea, and Ihey 
jusl bit on il. 
So, as of now, you don't 
know whether it'. going to 
be anim ..... or liv.action? 

No, we ha ve a really shitty 
scripl thaI we did not wrile, and 
we 're hoping for a rewrite. I've 
been begging for a rewrile, because 
I wanted 10 write it from the begin-
ning, but I'm not a professional 
screenwriter. They assume I'm just 
a guy that draws comic books, but 
Ihey realize that Scud is not a typi-
cal comic book, and it 's more like a 
movie on paper. 

Now they're staning to realize 
that they ' ve made a mistake, so 
I'm hoping that I will be able to 
get a shot to do it. But right now 
it 's so early in the game anl

there's so much polilics and eco-
nomics that have to be figured out 
before we can even start thinking 
about looking for a director. 

First, we have 10 make this 
script really good, and right now 
ii 's subpar. Once we' ve got a real -
ly good script, we can try and find 
a really good director. Once we ' ve 
gOI a really good director, we can 
all sit at a table and discuss what 
we' re going to do next. Then, 
hopefully, we ean start getting 
people attached, such as voice tal-
ent and actors and all that good 
stuff. visual people. 
How long haYe you been

\11 111\ lift: I I hln I had I ren-
~ It In Ill~ 1110 III , \YOI1l I1. I re mem-
ber hemg In kindergarten Jnd my 
teacher saying, 'You ' re such a good 
drawer, you sure do draw a lot.' I 
jusl listened to her, it 's a great way 
of getting attention. You just kind 
of nod your head and start coloring. 

I slarted doing comic books in 
high school because il was a great 
way of telling stories. I was 
obsessed with telling stories, J 
would always make my friends sil 
down and lislen to all Ihe dumb 
stories I would come up with, bUI 
I would never wrile them down 
because my hands would cramp 
up if I started wriling and I could-
n' t type. But I could draw, so I 
started drawing comic books as a 
melhod of telling slories. 

I did several books and every-
one- was like, 'You should tryout 
for Marvel. You should tryout for 
DC.' I gOI like a thousand rejec-
tion letters. Once I went to college 
and art school, I was a freelance 
illustrator and did the greeling 
cards and Ihe T-shirt designs and 
all this crap that I hated. 

Eventually I said, 'Okay, I'm 
going to go back 10 telling stories 
again .' That 's how Scud came 
about.

been deslroyed by an alien weapon. 
Rico stays on to fight the war

Director Paul Verhoeven 
("Tolal Recall," "Basic Instinct") 
shools for the (eel of a World War 
II propaganda film by advancing 
Ihe plot through a series of news 
clips. These clips (which aren'l 
much more than military adver-
tisemenls) clearly depict that the 
Earth has come under the rule of a 
military slate where service is 
glamorized for the sake of enlisl-

However, Verhoeven doesn'l 
show lhe darker reality of the war. 
Of course people die, but we don'l 
witness Ihe repercussions. 
Casuallies only fuel humanity's 
haIred of an enemy il doesn't 
understand. In the end, the SIOry 
ilself devolves into nothing more 
Ihan propaganda. 

The special effects are dazzling, 
of course. The film contains close 
to 550 visual-effects shots, An 
impressive number, considering 
last summer's '1'he Lost World" 
had closer 10 170, and the elaborate 
battle sequences rival those from 
classic war movies. 

While some of the mililary atti-
tude and humor worked, the back-
ground of lhe film sucked Ihe life 
out of an exciling story. .

England." 

Even though Ihe men '~ season 
came to a close last night al Triton 
Soccer Stadium with a 1-0 loss to 
ri val Claremont-M udd-Scri pps 
College, Armslrong and his staff 
deserve a ton of credit. 

With only two returning slarters, 
one of which was playing out of 
position, many experts expected 
this year to be a rebuilding year. 

That was not to be the case a~ 
Armstrong guided the youthful '97 
edition of the Tritons to a postsea-
son appearance for the 13th time in

"We also have a good coaching 
starr at the omad, so when Derek 
and I go away, they lill in lor LI S." 

SO far in the 1997 season. 
McManus' squad has outscored its 
opponent~ 49-5 and accumulated 
14 shutouts. 

Week after week, teams played 
their biggest games of 1997 againsl 
the Tritons, hoping to dethrone the 
Iwo-time champions. McManus 
and co. withslood the challenges 
and outlasted 17 of 19 challengers. 

Each game, UCSD seemed 
stronger, quicker and more deter-
mined than the opposing side. 

"Fitness is e)l.tremely impor-
lant," McManus said. "It's like 
Derek [Armstrong, UCSD men 's 
soccer coach I once told me, fitness 
isn't everything, but withoUl it, 
everylhing is losl. It's as simple as 
that. You can have all the skill in

' 'To be honest, it 's one of the 

beller seasons we 've had ," 
Armstrong said. "J feel pretty 
proud. Wc've come from a leam 
thai actuall y didn 't have but two 
staners from last year." 

Armslrong transformed the 
Trilons into a team that can take 
pride in it, season, and one Ihat can 
look forward to a bright future - a 
future constructed by one of the 
mo~t famous soccer architects in 
the nation. 

One thing is for SUfi: - whether 
it is the accent , the head-to-toe 
Umbro soccer gear or just the 
intense. hawk-like gaze, people 
who know championship ~occ.:c r 
know Ihe visage of Dcrt: k

"I think everyone expecis a lot

"Bri an nwde the adJuMlIlent

So whal if a Division I ~ch o() 1 
came calling'! 

" I wouldn ' t want to Icave San 
Dlcgo," McM anu~ said. '" couldn 't

would prefer to he on the soccer

the fields. Coaching here at UCSD 
has been a great e)l.perience and I 
slilllove it." 

For McManus and company it's 
another year and another trip deep 
into the poslseason. This weekend, 
they will be in Fredricksburg, Ya. 
for the NCAA Quarterfinals. 

So while the players have come 
and gone these past II years, one 
constanl has remained - the man 
slrolling the Triton sidelines has 
been Brian McManus.

KONNECTION 
DEREK: The San Diego soccer guru ha, never experi-
enced a losing season here and is responsible for three 
National Championship banners hanging in RIMAe 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 

Triton fan\, whenever you arc 
watching onc of Derek 
Anmtrong\ teams winning, he 
,ure to ~ay a lillie " thank you" to 
the financial ineptitude of the 

Columbus Magic. Had Ihal soccer 
cluh been a tad more ~uccessflll. 

Armstrong mlghl have never come out to 
San Diego 10 create his soccer 

empire. 
The Blackpool, England nallve I" 

Ihe architecl of Iwo unbelievably ~uc­
cessful succer program~ - Ihe La 10lla 
Nomads and the UCSD men 's soccer Icam. 

Both program\ arc re(;QgniLcd as nalional 
powerhouses In their re'pcctlve c ircles. 

BUI II IS frightening to think of just how 
close San Diego t.:ame to missing out on 
Armstrong. 

Armstrong ca mc ovcr from England to 
Columhus (Ohio), although he was affiliat-
ed with the Nomads as well . When the 
Magit.: became tangled up In financial 
struggles, Armstrong dedded it wa, time to 
go hack to the United Kingdom. 

" I had deCided to go back to the U.K .... 
ArmMrong said . ''The omads asked me to 
come back Ito San DiegoJ for six weeks. 
During the six weeks, I got a job offer to 
slay, and that 's basit.:ally how I got here." 

Armstrong was given the reins of lhe 
UCSD soccer program in 1982 and, under 
his walch, his leams have put logether a 
~pcctacular stnng of stati~tics. The most 
important of these feats are hanging on 
RIMAC walls : National Championship 
banners from 1988, 1991 and 1993. 

In the seven year~ prior to Armstrong's 
tenure, the Tritons amassed one winning 
scason. Since his arrival. UCSD has never 
experienced a losing season. 

Winning has been the constant theme in 
Armstrong's career; so much so that in 
1987, he was selected as Ihe national coach 
for the under-20 United Stales FIFA World 
Cup leam and i, currently a member of the 
U.S. ational Coaching Stafr. 

Anm.trong can even take panial respon-
si hility ror the success of the two-t ime 
defending National Champion CSD 
women 's sot.:cer [lrogram . He is a long-timl! 
Inend of cum:nt wOIl1l!n\ mach Brian 
McManus, and brought him 10 San Diego 
a, an assistant coach . He recomillended 
M cManus for the wOIIIl!n's job In 19H6.

season, has a record of 182-1!H7. 

BRIAN: Women's soccer 
head coach has led his team 
to three Division III titles 
By Sean Rahlml 
Senior Staff Wflter 

You might have seen him walking 
around campus. Usually clad in Umbro 
gear. the Scotsman with the thick accent 
goes hy the name of Brian McManus, but 
you t.:an just call him coach - Two-time 
NCAA Coach of Ihe Year to be exact. 

McManus came to UCSD as an assis-
tant coac h in 1986 after playing prores-
sionally in his home counlry for Ihe Raith 
Rovers and Aberdeen. He also spent II 
years as a semi-professional player and 
coach. Upon commg to Los Angeles in 
19HO, he spent ~ix years coaching semi-
pro soccer before traveling south to San 
Diego. 

" At first, [ said 'Oh, no way' Jwhen 
u\ked to coach the women's team in 
19861." McManus said. "I had never" 
coached women in my life, never been 
involved or even seen girls' soccer, but I 
decided to do it fur a year anu ,ee if it 
work, out. I enjoyed it, had a great time, 
and the rest is history." 

Now In his 11th season as the UCSD 
women 's soccer coach, McManm has 
hudt the he~t Divisioll III program in the 
nalioll, har none.

• PAINFUL: UCSD suffered a playoff 
defeat against Claremont College 
By Travis Hili 
Sports Editor 

It had a lillie bit of everything, except for a happy end-
Ing. 

La~t night's first round of the West Region of the 
CAA men \ ~occer playoff~ was a memorahle one. It 

featured two old rivals digging in for another chapter In 
their book of st ruggles. 

There were great shots, great saves, close calls and bad 
ca lls. All told, it was a war and, unfonunately for UCSD. 
it was a 1-0 Stag victory. 

It wa~ a heartbreaking defeat for the Triton~ . who lin-
I~hcd the season with an 11 -5-2 record. 

The first time UCSD met Claremont this year, it came 
out Jlat. Last night , that was not the case. Both teams 
came ou t aggressively. They went after every 50-50 ball. 
hattling for every pos:"esslOn. 

The Stags had a few dangerous possesslOn~ in the 
opening minutes, but the Triton defense, anchored bi 
John Brandon. Robert Bessler and goalkeeper Lucas 
Curtolo, held steady under the pressure. 

The Tritons then began to take their turns on the Stags' 
goa l. The Triton midfield, composed of Cameron Adams, 
Alex Glebov, Jacob Bollinger and Doug McBride, thd a 
good job of feeding forwards Anthony FUnlccllo and 
Brady BernarJ. The momentum was beginning to ,"wing 
In UCSD's direction. 

The Tritons also received some help from the Stags, .IS 
one stupid foul after another allowed the Tmons some 
dangerous free kicks right on top of the IS-yard box . 

Alas, UCSD could not get its set plays to work , and 
paid the price by squandering the attempts on goal. 

A single foul from Claremont changed the entire face 
of the match. Samir Singh, a Stag defender, committed a 
hrutaltackle from behind. earning him his second ye llow 
card and an ejection. 

This put the Triton at a man-advantage for the rest of 
the game, which under normal circumstances would have 
been great for UCSD. It proved to have a negative effect, 
though. Playing a man down, the Stags sank more defend-
ers back. That forced the Tritons to deviate from their 
game plan, and caused confusion. 

When Andrew Van Orden was able to sneak a fluke 
goal past Cunolo, the Stags took the lead. 

'The sending off [of Singh 1 actually cost us the game," 
Head Coach Derek Armstrong said, "because it forced us 
to make tactical changes, which threw us for arout 15 
minutes, and that ~as when the goal was scored." 

Realizing that their season was in serious jeopardy, the 
Tritons mounted a furious attack for the last 20 minutes of 
the match. UCSD came within inches of scoring on more 
than one occasion, but nothing fell , and the Tritons were 
left with the hurt of a painful loss. 

"We should have won," Andy Ewald said. 
Editor 's Note - For the record. this team Left every-

thing on the field Last night. It makes me sick to m ' stom-
ach that there were more Claremont fans there than ours 
to see the game. These guys deserved better than that. For 
those of you who just casually blew the game off - you 
should be ashamed of yourself.
