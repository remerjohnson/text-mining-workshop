entrepreneur and member of 
the Princeton University class

million to the university in 
conjunction with its upcoming 
250tb anniversary celebration. 
The gift will be used to

million to conduct a six-year 
study on the effects of alcohol-

program seeks to reduce the 
number of alcohol-related 
injuries by educating patients 
on the dangers of drinking. 
More than 100,000 people die 
annually from alcohol-related

The primary goal is to keep [UCSD] on an upward

out of a budget recession, and we're so delighted with our 
recent [National Research Council} rankings. They give us 
an academic stature which we, of course, knew all along, but 
now it's advertised as such. 

The campus is in pretty strong shape. We have problems, 
but we're on a roll, in a way. So, I wantto keep that going and 
to really have a smooth transition as we prepare for a 
permanent chancellor. This year could be uncomfortable if

Chancellor Search Amendments Would Allow More Student Control 
FALK: A.S. president 
calls for increased 
student representation 
By Esther Yoon 
Staff Writer 

UCSD's next chancellor could 
be voted on by students, if a new 
procedure for chancellor appoitment 
is approved at the Thurs., Nov. 16 
regents meeting. 

The proposed amendments, 
which call for increased student rep-
resentation on the search commit-
tee, as well as increased community 

involvement, were drafted by 
ASUCSD President Naomi Falk. 

I fapproved, the amendments will 
be effective immediately. The new 
UCSD chancellor will take office at 
the beginning of the 1996-97 aca-
demic year. 

"I would liketo see these amend-
ments passed by the regents as oon 
as possible, 0 our search for a new 
chancellor can get started," Falk said. 

The current 17-member chancel-
lor search colTlmittee has 10 voting 
members- five UCSD faculty mem-
bers and five regents. The remaining 
seven non-voting members include 

one alumnus one staff member, one 
UCSD Foundation member, the chair 
of the Board of Regents, the UCPresi-
dent and two student representatives 

. - one undergraduate and one gradu-
ate, selected by the A.S. and Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) councils. 

The first of Falk' propo ed 
amendments would expand the num-
ber of student committee members 
to three undergraduate and two 
graduate tudents. The amendment 
also calls for full voting privileges 
for the student members. 

"Students are most affected by 
the decision ofthechancellorsearch 

committee, but they have the least 
representation by the current UC 
systemwide policy,» Falk said. 

The second amendment would 
establish a procedure targeted at 
soliciting opinions from groups out-
side of the chancellor search com-
mittee. 

The amendment would require fi-
nalists for the chancellor position to 
meet with groups of students, faculty 
and staff members. Each group will 
meet with the prospective chancellors 
separately, and the meetings wiIJ be 
closed to the public to protect the

Despite growing concern over

Canyonview pool. The new lot is 

half the distance 
from Warren as lot

provided by T &PS

The campus was quick 10 take advan-
tage of it and mount some really ag-

The other thing I think you really 
have to give him credit for is that he 
appointed very competent people to 
head up the various units on the cam-
pus, and allowed for effective deccn-

tralization, so he didn' t have to per-

I think it's very important that, 

when the new chancellor comes, there 
is a mechanism for that person to 
relate to every part of the campus. 
Decentralization is just fine when it's 
all in place, but if you disrupt it at the 
lop, then you isolate the lop from [the 
rest oHhe campus]. So when the new 
person comes in, they oould feel a 
little bit like they are inan ivory lower.

To an extcnt, yes. One of the things

If they continue to keep raising 
fees, then it certainly is going to be a 
problem. There's no question about 
that. And they will only increase the 
fees if the state budget doesn't pro-
vide the necessary resources.

Economic Recession 
Justifies Boost in Tuition 

By Nathan Pietila 
Contributing Opinion Writer 

" 
ou [regents 1 have made 

students feel like they are not 
a high priority, not a low pri-
ority - nol even a priority," 
thundered ASUCSD Presi-

dent Naomi Falk aI a nant UC Board of Regents 
meeting. At issue was a 7 .1-percent fee increase, 
recommended by recently installed UC President 
Richard Atkinson. Given the economic turmoil 
California has endured this decade, the angry re-
action of students like Falk is understandable. 

Californians are working harder than ever to 

Contrary to 
the popular · 
idea that 
the regents 
have cared 
little about 
these 
student 
concerns, 
university 
leadership 
during the 
fiscal crisis 
of the 1990s 
has been 
exemplary. 

~ 

make ends meet, but are find-
ing it very difficult to stay 
afloat in an economy ravaged 
by federal defense cutbacks 
and more than its share of 
natural disasters. So, when 
the UC Board of Regents 
votes to raise student fees, 
students and their families 
can't help but feel- as Falk 
does - betrayed. However, 
it is unreasonable to de-
nounce the regents as traitors 
to the vision embodied in 
California's Master Plan for 
Higher Education. 

Originally adopted in 
1960, the plan posits three 
principles: high-quality edu-
cational programs, open ac-
cess for qualified students and 
affordability. On the surface, 
a policy of increasing student 
fees seems to compromise the 
last two principles. Higher 
fees appear to make the UC 
even less accessible to poorer 

students. The cost of today's UC education 
doesn't seem to be affordable in any sense of the 
term. 

However, contrary to the popular idea that 
the regents have cared little about these student 
concerns, university leadership during the fJScai 
crisis of the 19905 has been exemplary. Largely 
because the regents made tough, but correct, de-
cisions to secure its future, the UC still stands 
unrivaled among public institutions in terms of 
the quality of education. It is no secret that 
when the economy falters, as has nantly 
been the case in California, government 
revenues necessarily decline. It is there-
fore mandatory in such situations 
for the government, like pri-
vale firms, to tighten its belt. 

Thus, in an era of limited

Are the Regents Truly at 
·Fault for the Rising Cost of a 

UC Education? 
Regents Should Have Explored 

Other Options 
By Wayne Wong 

Contributing Opinion Writer 

It seems that everyone knows the cliche of the starving student - every-one, that is, except the UC Board of Regents. With the latest proposal of a 7.1-percent fee hike (initiated by none other than fonner UCSD Chan-cellor Richard Atkinson), the regents have proven that they are truly 
out of touch with the needs of the UC system, particularly those of the 

students, the system's most important part. Although the budget must be bal-
anced, putting a lion 's share of the $40.3 million budget shortfall on the stu-
dents is the wrong way to achieve this goal. 

The 7. I-percent increase amounts to $270 per year, ~ringing the total 
fees to $4,409. Assuming no other increases, this translates into a $1 ,080 
increase for a four-year education. (Four years and no increases? Yeah, 
right.) This is not a trifling amount. Do you k.now anyone who has an 
extra thousand dollars lying around? 

There are ways to balance the UC budget without raising 
fees. The regents should know this. They've done it be-
fore. Last year, amid a propoSal by our "education gover-
nor" to raise student fees by 10 percent for the 1995-96 aca-
demic year, both the regents and the state government found 
a way to avoid the increase. 

They agreed to a "non-binding compact" which would 
boost state funding in lieu of fee hikes up to 1 0 percent for 
four years. But just what is the purpose of a non-bind-
ing compact? Isn't that like non-alcoholic beer? 
As a result of this "agreement," the UC lias 
to petition the state for funds each time 
fees rise, which ~rns to be just 
about every year.

COMMENTARY: Despite the violent and hateful calls to violence by some alternative publications on campus, 
we must not restrict freedom of speech 

UCSD's FREE SPEECH AT RISK 
By Goon Pllttanumotana 
Special to the Guardian 

"Deatll elf a Migra Pig" was the 
title of an editorial article pub-
lished last May in Voz Fronteriza , 
an A.S.-funded publication repre-
senting alternative and Chicano 
views at UCSD. The A.S. funds 
several publications through the 
allocation of mandatory student 
fees - including the liberal New 
Indicator, conservative UCSD Re-
view and the humorous Koala . Voz 
Fronteriza came under the spot-
light with its controversial article 
concerning the accidental death of 
U.S. Border Patrol agent Luis 
Santiago. The anonymous piece 
made such bold statements as "We 
are glad he is dead, " and" All 
migra pigs deserve death." 

Although newspapers have the 
right to print whatever they want, 
their credibility within the general 
community will always be in 
question. Many articles are aimed 
at a specific audience. If an article 
offends someone, he can take ac-
tion without violating free speech. 

That is, without infringing 
upon this First Ammendment 
right, people can take measures to 
effectively voice disapproval of a 
tasteless or offensive article. 
When the National Rifle Associa-
tion (NRA) alleged in a recent 
fund raising letter that the govern-
ment was composed of "black-
hooded storm troopers," many 

supporters - including former 
President George Bush - can-
celed their NRA memberships. 
Without censoring the free speech 
of the NRA, enraged members 
were still able to publicize their 
opinions. Along these same lines, 
those who have voiced concerns 
about Voz Fronteriza have possi-
bly caused the paper to lose some 
readership, and certainly some 
credibility. 

Congressman Duncan Hunter 
recently condemned Voz 
Fronteriza, claiming that it was 
not only morally wrong to con-
done Luis Santiago'S death, but 
that the comments violated the 
civil rights of all federal agents. 
His response brought significant 
editorial reaction across the state. 
The San Diego Union-Tribune and 
KNSD both presented editorials 
addressing the issue of freedom of 
speech - as did some media out-
lets from across the nation. In 
bringing these tasteless comments 
by the Voz Fronleriza into focus, 
Hunter seriously damaged its 
campuswide legitimacy. 

The problem with Hunter's ap-
proach, however, was that he went 
further. He proceeded to draft a 
letter to the UCSD administration 
requesting an apology from them 
and Voz Fronleriza. According to 
the leiter" if UCSD refused to 
apologize and retract the editorial, 
Hunter promised that he would

publications advocate the killing 
of American officers." By restruc-
turing his attack to include legis-
lation that would violate the 
publication 's free speech, Hunter 
weakened his own cause. 

Every U.S. citizen is protected 
by the First Amendment of the 
U.S. Constitution, which states, 
"Congress shall make no law .. . 
abridging the freedom of speech 
or of the press." Regardless of 
what a specific organization may 
print, its statements arc - and 
should be - pro ected under this 
provision. And protection is non-
discriminatory. It extends to 
groups as extreme as the Commu-
nist Party and the Ku Klux Klan 
(KKK). 

Brandenburg v. Ohio (1967) 
was the U.S. Supreme Court 's 
most significant decision concern-
ing free speech for extremist 
groups. A news reel showed a 
group of KKK members waving 
guns in the air and threatening 
anyone standing in the way of 
their white-supremacy goals . 
Rather than censor this group and 
its beliefs, the U.S. Supreme Court 
ruled that extremist organizations 
have the right to express their be-
liefs non-violently. 

In the wake of this decision, a 
few universities have tried to cen-
sor on-campus alternative newspa-
pers: 

• In Pap ish v. Board of Cura-

tors of the University of Missouri 
(1973), the U.S. Supreme Court 
overturned the right of the univer-
sity to prohibit a student newspa-
per from running a cartoon depict-
ing a policeman raping the Statue 
of Liberty. 

• In Joyner Yo Whiling (1973) , 
the court overruled a university 'S 
defunding of a publication for 

. printing articles in support of seg-
regation. 

• I n Schiff v. Williams (1975), 
Florida Atlantic University fired 
the editor of a student newspaper 
because his publication failed to 
meet the university 'S guidelines of 
quality. The court found the firing 
a violation of the First Amend-
ment. 

The UCSD administration, 
like that of so many other univer-
sities, has been unable to control 
the content of its student publica-
tions. In the case of the Voz 
Fronleriza, the administration 
stated that cutting off the paper 's 
funding would be impossible and 
unconstitutional. Only ASUCSD 
has the power to halt funding, but 
even that would be ruled a viola-
tion of free speech. 

During the last four years, sev-
eral incidents at UCSD have chal-
lenging the idea of free speech and 
free press:

oosts and exploit alternative revenue 
sources to maintain its statils as the 
nation's premiere public institution of 
higher education. And in protecting 
the quality of a UC education from 
the vicissitudes of government fund-
ing, the UG has had to raise revenues 
through fee increases. Nevertheless, 
the principle of affordable education 
has not been compromised, due to a 
solid commitment by the UC to link 
fee increases with increases in the 
level of student financial aid. 

The choice facing the UC is a 
simple one. Either compromise qual-
ity to continue charging exceptionally 
low fees to all students - regardless 
of their ability to pay - or ask more 
affluent students to pay higher fees, 
while ensuring that less fort unate stu-
dents receive enough financial aid to 
cover the increased costs. While the 
latter option does not compromise any 
ofthe Master Plan 's ideals, the former 
sacri fices quality to prop up an essen-

HIKE: 
Continued from paee 4 

Increasing student fees should not 
be a quick fix. It should be the last 
resort. The regents are pushing the 
panic button too quickly. It 's doubt-
ful whether they have they exhausted 
all other options, considered cuts in 
other parts of the budget or sought 
more federal aid. 

Let's examine that last option-
federal aid. Surely the federal govern-
ment has $40 million it can spare. 
After all, it spends countless billions 
every year building fighters and tanks 
in a noble effort to defend our coun-
try. And what the government officials 
don 't realize is that if they keep spend-
ing so much on defense, soon there 
won't be anything to defend. With-
out successive generations of compe-
tent citizens, we will be a hollow na-
tion. 

Our country also disperses an in-
ordinate amount of money in foreign 
aid. If the federal government has 
enough money to give to Russia, it 
must have some it can give to us, its 
future leaders. 

In fact, the federal government 
does have money. President Clinton's 
"Goals 2000" plan has allocated $42 
million for California schools. The 
UC lacks $40.3 million. If I do my 
math correctly, that 's about a $1.7 

o. 

tially regressive fee structure. 
Fee increases are often deemed 

unfair to students. It is hard to see why 
this is so, given that fee increases have 
the same effect as a progressive in-
come tax. Those who can afford to 
pay more are asked to do so, while 
the less affluent benefit from in· 
creased financial aid. If looked at from 
this - albeit leftist - point of view, 
fee increases seem eminently fair. 

Moreover, the UC's commitment 
to fundi ng financial aid is not illusory. 
The UC is required to set aside at least 
one-third of any additional fee rev-
enue for financial aid. In fiscaJ year 
1990-91, over $33 million of UC stu-
dent fees went toward funding finan-
cial-aid programs. This fiscal year, 
that figure will have nearly qua-
drupled to $123 million. Aside from 
the university, the state has also pro-
vided for large increases in financial-
aid funding. In fiscal ycar 1990-91 , 
the state's General Fund contributed 
nearly $250 million to financial aid. 
This year, that figure has nearly 
doubled to over $450 million. The UC 

million surplus - almost enough to 
build another Library Walk. Although 
the Goals 2000 money is not intended 
for universities, perhaps the state 
could shuffle around the budget so the 
UC could benefit. 

Here lies the snag: Pete Wilson 
doesn't want the federal funds. Wil-
son criticizes Goals 2000's "many 
strings," which are typical of the con-
trolling federal government. How-
ever, when asked to specify the na-
ture of these constraints, Wilson and 
other critics are left speechless. What 
conditions are these people against 
anyway? The plan calls for "student 
achievement and citizenship," as we)) 
as "disciplined, drug-free schools." 
Obviously, those who oppose these 
ideals should not be fighting on the 
side of education. I suggest the gov-
ernor find another way to send his 
political message to the White House. 

This recent round of proposed fee 
hikes is only the latest in a series of 
attacks against UC students. With the 
end of affinnative action, proposed 
legislation to cut federal financial aid 
and fee hikes galore, it's surprising 
students have survived. 

But students have another reason 
to be concerned. If we step far enough 
away from the particular issue of a 
7.l-percent fee hike, we see some-
thing even more fright~ing : the 
trend. In 1986, fees were about

and the state have done a good job 
ensuring that qualified students of 
limited means are not turned away. 

Also, consider the following: The 
cost of educating a full-time, in-state 
UC student during the 1994-95 school 
year was $13,191. Sixty-two percent 
of this cost was provided by the state's 
General Fund; UC students pay only 
29 percent of the total cost of their 
education. Between 1987 and 1994, 
the cost of a UC education increased 
from around $1,250 to $4,139. This 
represents an increase of about 230 
percent. But consider the track record 

$) ,000. With the latest increase, that 
amounts to approximately a 300 per-
cent increase in 10 years - a figure 
far above the economy's inflation rate. 
The regents and legislators resort to 
fee increases far too easi I y. 

This alarming trend is true not only 
for the UC system, but for the Cali-
fornia State University system as well. 
This week, the CSU Board of Trust-
ees will consider a 9.8-percent hike 
in student fees. The trend is pervasive. 

Even if students do find a way to 
absorb this latest assault on their pock-
etbooks, will they be able to handle 
the next one, and the one after that? 
Fee hikes must stop now: lftheydon' t, 
they might never stop. The last 10 
years can attest to that. 

California is in a dangerous frame 
of mind right now. It considers edu-
cation a non-priority and students ex-
pendable. Perhaps this is because stu-
dents represent a minority of the vot-
ing population. Legislators and mem-
bers of the UC Board of Regents have 
forgotten the tired, but nevertheless 
true, saying: "Education is the key to 
the future." 

The regents are, in essence, seal-
ing their own fate. The students of to-
day will be the businessmen, scien-
tists and teachers of tomorrow. A stu-
dent who cannot afford to go to school 
will cease to be a student, most likely 
becoming a less-productive member 

of California's private institutions 
over the same period. The average 
tuition for five of California 's best 
private colleges - Stanford, Univer-
si ty of Southern Ca lifo rn ia, 
Pepperdine, Claremont and Pomona 
- went from $ I 1,346 in 1987 to 
$18,218 in 1994. This represents an 
increase of over 60 percent. 

One might conclude from these 
figures that the UC has a worse record 
of keeping tuition inflation in check. 
But when ascertaining the 
affordability of college tuit ion, we 
need to consider the resources of the 
families who pay for it. Consider UC 
fees and private-school tuition as a 
percentage of disposable income per 
capita. Over the period 1987-1994, 
annual tuition at the five private col-
leges averaged out to be 81.1 percent 
of disposable income per capita. 

Roughly four out of every five 
dollars of the average person 's take-
home pay would be needed to cover 
the cost of private-school tuit ion. This 
is highway robbery, any way you look 
at it. But compare this to the relatively 

OPINION 7 

modest income bite of 11.9 percent 
for the UC during the same period. 
Only one Hut of every eight dollars of 
personal take-home pay is needed to 
pay for UC tuition. For families who 
plan their futures carefully, a UC edu-
cation is still very affordable. And for 
those less fortunate students, the UC 
still offers adequate financial support. 

Make no mistake about it: A qual-
ity education is an expensive propo-
sition. Those of us fortunate enough 
to attend the UC should be mindful 
of the fact that very few people in the 
world have the opportunity to study 
at a world-class educational institu-
tion. Instead of obsessing over an is· 
sue which we can do little to change 
- given this state 's fiscal ci rcum-
stances - we should concentrate on 
more important issues, such as the 
deplorable state of undergraduate 
teaching and the unwarranted 
politicization of curriculum. By get-
ting needlessly sidetracked on the is-
sue offee increases, we squander op-
portunities for real enhancement of 
the UC ex·perience. 

RISING FEES AT UCSD 
Over the last 10 years, the cost of a UCSD education has risen 
dramatically. A 7 .1% increase has been proposed for next year. 
These figures do not include campus-specific fees.

of society. Decision-makers need to 
realize that education isn't cheap -
there are no sales and no coupons. We 
need to pay the full price for knowl-
edge, or else we will get a second-
rate product: a generation of students 
unable to compete in the global arena. 

Another frightening prospect of 
these higher fees may be the return to 
the elitist society of old, where only 
the wealthy were educated, and the 
poor were left to inherit the burden of 
manual drudgery. We cannot afford 
to lose the progress we've made in 
lessening the self-propagating sepa-
ration between rich and poor. 

Almost half of all students at uc

schools receive some type of finan-

because they >need it However, iffees 
keep increasing, no amount of aid will 
help. Those students will be thrown 
into the uneducated abyss of mini-
mum-wage labor, with little hope of 
getting out. 

The regents must be weaned 
from fee hikes. They should chan-
nel their efforts into securing funds 
from other sources. Or, if they must 
increase fees, it should be manda-
tory that they include a realistic pro-
posal of how students might actu-
ally pay for them. I ' m sure that 
would stump the regents.

CHANCELLOR'S SELECTION PROCESS CLARIFIED 
Editor: 

I am writing to correct an error 
in Thursday 's editorial concerning 
the voting rights of members of the 
Chancellor 's Search Committee 
(" UCSD Students Should Select 
UCSD's Chancellor," Nov. 9, 1995). 
The editorial stated that community 
members on the search committee 
have voting rights. 

This is not true. Only the regent 
and faculty representatives are vot-
ing committee members. Staff, stu· 
dents, community and alumni mem-
bers participate fully in the search 
and deliberation process, but are not 
voting members. I believe that the 
right to vote originates from the 
UC's historic policy of faculty-ad-
ministration shared governance of 
the university. In this case, shared 
governance is represented by the re-
gent and faculty members on the 
search committee. 

Perhaps more to the point , 
searches of this nature rarely require 
a vote. A consensus regarding the

A. real DEPARTURE from eM ORDINARY 

ity has shown, San Diego teachers are 
unhappy with their current $44,000 
average salary, so it seems unlikely 
they would settle for a TNs income, 
especially when it comes with no ben-
efits except basic health insurance. 

Lab technicians could perhaps re-
place grad students as RAs in science 
labs, but your average lab tech isn 't 
going to work for an RA's money, and 
it isdoubtfulthallhey are more quali-
fied than RAs. Besides, if people 
could be found "to approach these 
things as jobs, .. they should be entitled 
to form a union, if they see fit. 

In fact, Dean Atliyeh knows that 
graduate students are an irreplaceable 
source of cheap, extremely quaJjfied 
labor, and that it is the Association of 
Student Employee's threat to cut off 
this labor which has made them so 
nervous. 

A certain fifth-year physics gradu-
ate student was once required to work 
around 70 hours per week in her 
professor 's lab. After five years of not 
getting any commitment from her 

Fronteriza as a humorous student 
publication not to be taken seri-
ously. After the opinion was pub-
lished, the writer received death 
threats warning him to "watch his 
back." Voz Fronteriza denied any 
involvement but felt that he de-
served the threats. 

professor on when she could gradu-
ate, she was finally told it would hap-
pen in two years. When she said that 
she would be leaving for law school 
in two months, her professor said she 
could graduate in the next six months. 
This is known by every science gradu-
ate student: Time spent in labs 
persuing an advanced degree is not 
directly tied to any necessary gradu-
ate training, but to the advisors' will-
ingness to exploit the cheap labor their 
RAs provide. 

'This is not an argument in favor 
ofstudent unionization, nor do I wish 
to claim that all graduate students are 
treated poorly by their advisors. 
Rather, I want to point out what is at 
stake in the ASE issue. The adminis-
tration is not concerned with what is 
in the best educational interests of 
graduate students, and it is not doing 
them any favors. Instead, it is attempt· 
ing to maintain unfettered control over 
the cheapest source of skilled aca· 
demic labor it has available.

It's important because you want to 
be sure the citizenry has an education. 
No matter who you are, whet her you're 
part ofany particular race orgenderor 
religious group, you should have ac, 
cess to the qll a tity of education you're 
capable of. 

The second reason is, supposing 
you have a university community that 
doesn 't reflect the composition of the 
populace - as UCSD is now - you 
will ultimately lose the sUpJXlrt of the 
community. They are the taxpayers 
and the voting members who really 
supportthis institution, and why would 
they wantto sUpJXlrt an institution that 
doesn 't reflect their comJXlsitional 
interests?

The only people that vote, accord·

the staff, the alumni and the commu-

why they don't extend the vote to all 
members of the committee. [ person, 
ally think they should. But the other 
side of this is the committee doesn 't 
really vote anyway. It 's all done by 
debate, discussion and by reaching a 
consensus on the pool of candidates.

overall budget for the campus, it's 
only supported by the state by 19 
percent. It may not sound like much, 
but all those other dollars are targeted 
fo r a~eas outside of our educational 
mission. So, they can 't be transferred

The San Diego Chargers 

Story by Ivan Delventhal 
Photos by Yakov Zolotorev 

ith the tem-
perature at 

kickoff a com-
fortable 69 de-

grees, and the 
skies clear and 

sunny, few could 
have anticipated the storm heading toward 
Jack Murphy Stadium and the Chargers team 
on Sunday. In fact, to the Chargers and their 
fans, tbe beautiful afternoon was anytbing 
but - as the biting, vicious winds clamped 
down and sent tbe San Diego squad a re-
sounding wake-up call. 

Witb a 22-7 drubbing at the hands of the 
NFL-leading Kansas City Chiefs (9-1), the 
Chargers fell to 4-6 and trudged deeper into 
the whirlwind which has become the 1995-
96 season. Before a erowd of 59,285 Charger 
fans, San Diego - wh ich depends heav ily 0 n 
tbe run - was never able· to get in sync 
offensively, managing an anemic 70 yards 
rushing. 

Chargers running back Natrone Means 
did not suit up for Sunday's contest due to a 
groin injury he suffered in the first quarter of 
last week's game against Miami. In contrast 
to San Diego's ground woes, Kansas City 
was able to wear the Chargers down with a 
conservative, yet efficient running attack. 
Tbe Chiefs highlights included veteran 
tailback Marcus Allen, who rushed for 63 
yards on 16 carries, and second-year man 
Greg Hill, who ran for 78 yards on 17 carries. 

"Over the course of the last tbree games 
we have begun to put some of the pieces 
together," Chiefs Head Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer said. "Overall, I thought we 
ran the ball pretty well. We got some yards 
that, frankly, you don't expect to get from 
[the Chargers)." 

The Chiefs notched the game's first score 
five minutes into the first quarter. After a 13-
yard punt return by youngster Tamarick 
Vanover, Kansas City marched deliberately 
down the field, mixing a series of well-

CHIEFS 

executed running plays with a 16-yard pass 
play to wideout Webster Slaughter on a cru-
cial third-and-nine at the San Diego 46. 

On second down and goal at the Chargers ' 
two-ya rd line, quarterback Steve Bono 
reached into his bag of tricks, delivering a 
Copperfield-like play-fake, followed by a 
naked bootleg around the right end - in 
which hcskipped untouched into theendzone. 
With kicker Lin Elliott's extra point, the 
Chiefs grabbed the early 7-0 lead. 

On their next possession, the Chargers 
appeared ready to put up a fight. On first-and-
ten from the San Diego 20, quarterback Stan 
Humphries handed to Rodney Culver, who 
scampered off left tackle for a pickup of 16 
yards. Two plays later, facing a third-and-
three on the Chargers ' own 43, Humphries 
connected with Ronnie Harmon down the 
left sideline for a 31-yard gain, taking the 
Chargers to the Chiefs' 26-yard line. 

TheChargers caught a break several plays 
later, when Humphries hit tight end Duane 
Young across the middle, who then rumbled 
down to the Kansas City four before being 
undercut by safety Mark Collins. The Charg-
ers then scored on a one-yard dive up the 
middle by Cu Iver, capping an eight-play, 80- · 
yard drive which tied the contest at 7·7. 

Unfortunately fortheChargers, the touch-
down would be their only score of the day. 

"We jus! didn't do what we are capable of 
doing," said Humphries, who finished with 
244 yards on 21-42 attempts. "When you 
don'l run the football very well, they are 
going to pin their ears back and come after 
the passing game, and that makes it even 
harder for the guys up front." 

On IheChiefs' next possession, the Charg-
ers' defense picked up the pace, as Seau 
sacked Bono for a three-yard loss to close out 
the first quarter. However, after a three-and-
out series by the Chargers to start the Second 
quarter, Vanover - whom the Chargers re-
member from their overtime loss to Kansas 
City on Oct. 9 - returned a Darren Bennett 

DEFENSIVE STATISTICS 

punt 26 yards to the San Diego 30. 
Elliott put a positive spin on the otherwise 

unsuccessful Chiefs series, booting a 47-
yard field goal between the uprights at the 
12: 13 mark, increasing Kansas City'S lead to 
10-7. Elliolt wasn't done, however, as he 
smacked a 48-yarder eight minutes later. 

After the half, the Chargers ' offense sput-
tered' bumping and stalling like an out-of-
tune Pinto. Dropped passes, short gains and 
numerous penalties prevented the Chargers 
from gaining any momentum. 

"We made a lot of mistakes out there and 
didn'tget the job done," cornerback Dwayne 
Harper said. "We played in spurts ... up and 
down. You can't play like that and expect to 
win." 

Perhaps the only bright spot in the contest 
came at the end of the third quarter, when 
Charger All-Pro Leslie O'Neal buried Bono 
for his looth career sack. 

Kansas City's final touchdown came in 
the third quarter after a 12-play, 82-yard 
drive. Allen sl ipped into the endzone on a 
one-yard run at the 6:16 mark, giving the 
Chiefs a 19-7 lead. Despite the failed two-
point con .... ersion attempt, the Chiefs were in 
command of the game. A 34-yard field goal 
midway through the fourth quarter closed out 
the scoring. 

Despite their nearly flawless record, the 
Chiefs refused to rest on their laurels. 

"We have a good team, with the possibil-
ity of being a great team. That takes one step 
at a time. We are not going to look too far 
down the road," Allen said. 

The Chargers, on the other hand, seemed 
puzzled by the season's difficulties and 
pledged to keep working hard. 

"Adversity brings on togetherness ... close-
ness. Right now, we are in Ihe midst of a 
storm," receiver Shawn Jefferson said. " If 
we don't hold together now, how could we 
hold together when we' re winning? We have 
got to ante up and knuckle down, and keep 
fighting."

danced its way to a 9-1 
record Sunday at the ex-

Wlth the recent attention on dotnMtic violence, a La JoLla rMiJent prOVM that 
hope neverthe0d rMiJed in a concerned citizenJ IegMlative determination 

ithin hours after OJ. 
Simpson's acquittal, 

battered women lost hope 
in the fight against domestic 

violence. 
One Associated Press article reported 

that calls to domestic-violence hotlines 
dropped nationwide. Over half the beds 
in one women's shelter in Texas emptied. 
Defendants in battering cases demanded 
trials because they thought juries may see 
them sympathetically. 

One Northern California man slashed 
his wife with a butcher knife because 
"0.1. got away with it, and so will I," 
police reported. 

Despite such hor-
rible incide~ts, GUARDIAN 
people who dls- F 
missthelegalsys- EATURES 
tern as defunct 
may look to Dian 
Black, a 42-year-old La 10lla resident 
and mother of two. As a concerned citi-
zen, she decided one day to write a new 
law on domestic violence. 

"J was thinking about a domestic-vio-
lence case with a girl [knew at San Diego 
State [University 1 who could not get a 
restraining order filed ... The judge wasn't 
convinced, even though campus police 
had taken all the necessary po rice re-
ports," she said. 

Black spoke with a few of the people 
she had known through the women and 
children's causes for which she had 
worked during the 19605' and 1970s, and 
dropped by state Senator Lucy Killea's 
office with her concerns. 

There, she was told to go ahead with 
writing a bill on her own and to solidt 
support from different legislators who 
might be interested. 

"J was surprised and honestly felt like 
I didn't know where I was going. So, I 
just sat down at the computer and started 
writing about what I felt should be done," 
Black said. "My interest was in helping 
battered .,en get restraining orders 
and protection that they need without 
having to wait, or without having to deal 
with so many of the constraints that the 
system I was looking at involved."

RESPONSE: 
Getting swift 
legislative action 
Continued fronl .,..e 14 

Black was further surprised 
with the immediate response she 
received from the government. 
After drllftrng her work on the 
bill, she sent it out to several leg-
islators. Within 30 m·inutes, she 
was faxed back a response from 
Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl 
(D-Encino), who agreed to author 
Black's bill. 

The bill required the state Ju-
dicial Council to oUlline clear in-
structions on filing contempt 
charges against abusers who vio-
late restraining orders. 

For women filing restraining 
orders, Black's bill will entail the 
court's provision of explicit in-
structions for filing and having 
the order enforced pro per, which 
does not require an attorney. It 
will also provide a fee waiver in 
filing contempt charges. 

Giving the issue even more mo-
mentu m, Senator Tom Hayden (D-
Santa Monica) drafted the bill 's 
suggestions into his own legisla-
lion, Senate Bill 187. Black also 
solicited support from the Na-
tional Organization for Women 
of California. 

"I don't believe in tying my-
self to one single cause, but ap-
pealing to different interest groups 
in areas they can work with," 
Black said. 

"Protection should be acces-
sible to everyone, and should be 
enforced thoroughly. Groups like 

N.O. W. address these specific is-
sues, and they're accessible to 
community members with per-
sonal interest,"'She added. 

After passing through state As-
sembly and Senate, Black's sug-
gestions were written into Cali-
fornia law and will be effective 
Jan. 1, 1996. 

The experience of "stumbling 
into· the lawmaking procedure 
was not the intangible process 
which Black had envisioned be-
fore diving into it. 

"I wish I had realized sooner 
thai one person like myself could 
effectively change the ways things 
are done," she said. "This was 
just one bill, one item that went 
by so fast and was so understood 

. that it's given me some more en-
ergy about facing women's is-
sues." 

As a professional arbitrator 
and mediator, Black has spent 
he,r career working with different 
groups through dispute resolu-
tion, in areas ranging from com-
merciallitigation to international 
contracts. 

Black, a graduate from Ihe Uni-
versity of San Diego's paralegal 
program, has also spend much of 
her time fundraising for child-
and wife-abuse prevention 
groups. She believes that she 
came into the process of drafting 
legislation from personal inter-
est. 

This interest, she said, had ac-
cumulated over many years and 
evolved into an agenda for politi-
cal activism. 

"I did my share of protesting 
and was an activist on so many

issues during the '60s and '70s," 
Black said. "By the '80s, some of 
my energy had worn off." 

Her motivation to adjust and 
simplify the particular process of 
filing restraining orders came 
from witnessing a friend's diffi-
culties with the court system. The 
law which resulted from Black's 
experiences will shift the process 
of obtaining a restraining order 
from the victim to law enforce-
ment, sht; said. 

Black's personal association 
with women's issues dates fur-
ther back, from her own encoun-
ters with sexual harassment. 

"By this point in my life, I 
thought I wanted to do what I 
could for these issues passively, 
but I'm always considering and 
reminded of this responsibility I 
have for my community and of 
my personal experiences," she 
said. 

Besides a renewed vigor for 
championing women's issues, 
Black cites the "necessity" of edu-
cating community members, "es-
pecially students," about the ac-
cessibility of the state legislative 
system. 

She is currently involved in a 
mentor program with students at 
SDSU, and is called frequently 
by individual groups to lecture on 
family-related issues. Black also 
chairs the Children at Risk Study, 
sponsored by Ihe League of 
Women Voters. 

"Getting things done requires 
two steps: raising noise and aware-
ness about an issue, and then ac-
tually doing something about it, 
like writing legislation or sup-

Greeks in the Community 
Quest for the Golden Heart Adds to the Long List of 

Philanthropic Efforts by UCSD Greek System 
Last week. on the dates of 

November 1st through 
November 4th, the Sigma Phi 
Epsilon fraternity hosted their 
first annual "Quest for the 
Golden Heart. W This event 
was a competition between 
all nine Panhellenic sororities, 
with all proceeds from the 
competition going to the 
Center for Child Protection. 
This philanthropy is done on 
the national level of Sigma 
Phi Epsilon fraternity mostly 
in the eastern United States 
and the UCSD chapter was 
one of the first chapters in the 
west to adopt the program. 

The competition 
consisted of four events: The 
Banner Competition, the 
"Kids at Heart Talent Show," 
the Kindergarten Olympics, 
and the Philanthropy Day. 
Each event shared the 
common llkids" theme due to 
the nature of the charity 

benefitted, so all of the 
participants were encouraged 
to let out their inner child and 
have a great time being the 
kids we once were. All of the 
events were light hearted and 
fun, making the competition a 
great experience for all. 

The winners of the week 
long competition were the 
sisters of Delta Delta Delta, 
followed by Delta Gamma in 
second place, and Kappa 
Alpha Theta in third. The 
talent show was conquered 
by the team of Alpha Chi 
Omega and Delta Gamma, 
who did a take off on the 
"Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangersw tracking down and 
getting the Golden Heart back 
from that lovable turned 
deranged dinosaur "Barney." 
All of the girls participating 

show~d great enthusiasm and 
support for the event, helping 
the first annual "Quest" 

become an enormous 
success. The brothers of 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, primarily 
through sponsorships and T-
Shirt sales, were able to raise 
hundreds of dollars for the 
Center For Child Protection. 

This is not the only 
Greek philanthropy on 
campus by any means, 
however. Many of the 
different fraternities and 
sororities also have different 
philanthropies that benefit 
either a local or national 
charity.

New Greek Chapter Adviser 
Randy Woodard Takes Action 

Randy Woodard is 
the new IFCI 
Panhellenic Advisor at 

UCSO. Randy was the AS 
advisor from 1979-1993 and 
is now the AS adviSor to the 
Co-ops, Enterprises, Media 
and Service Organizations. 

Though Randy has 
worked mainly with the 
Associated Students in the 
past, it is surprising to find 
out that Randy is the one 
respOnsible for starting the 
Greek system on the UCSD 
campus. Randy started the 
Phi Delta Theta, TI<E and 
Delta Sigma Phi fraternities 
and developed an expansion 
·project for the Greeks back 
in 1980. At the time, 
fraternities were student 
organizations and he wanted 
to have a stronger Greek 

system on campus. In turn, 
he started the Inter-
Fraternity Council. Randy's 
experience with the 
Associated Students and his 
involvement with the Greek 
system will prove to be a 
valuable asset to all. 

On another note, the 
Student Organiza,tion & 
Leadership Opportunities 
[SOLO] is hosting a seminar 
called 'TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF 
INTERNSHIP 
OPPORTUNITIES' which 
will be presented by Randy 
Woodard. It will be

The Beta Theta Pi duo of 
Andy Damron and Chandra 
Kiamilev played an almost 
flaw less tournament last 
week on their way to 
winning the IFC Tennis 
competition last week. The 
championship game was 
almost a whitewash as they 
defeated ZBT 6-0, 6-2 giving 
Betas 50 points and moving 
them into third place 
overall. The best matches of 
the tournament were in the 
semifinals as the Betas 
defeated the defending 
champions, IAE. Rallying 
from a 4-1 deficit, Damron 
and Kiamilev posted an 
impressive comeback to win 
10-7: The other semifinal 
matched featured ZBT and IN 
in the only tie breaker of the 
tournament with ZBT coming 
out on top 11-10 (12-10). 

In the Panhellenic 
oompetition, Aon earned 

their first victory of the 
new season, defeating 
AXOin the 
championship match, 
7-6,6-3. The win 
moved AOn into a 
third place overall tied with 
the Kappas and the Chi 0' s. 
There was much competition 
this year due to strong 
players from each team. 
However, in the end, team 
AOPi rallied their way to 
number one.

those became a Regal score, when 
its defense again won the game by 
turning back a Triton spike. 

"[The Regals) played the big 
points f'eaiIy well in games one and 
two," Dannevik said. "That's where 
they won the match." 

Game three was an exercise in 
tenacity for a UCSD squad which 
simply refused to go down. Cal 
Lutheran jumped out to a 6-2 lead, 
but the Tritons began to peck away 
- powered by the inspired hitting 
of senior Angelle Crochet (18 kills), 
Biesheuvel and Dana Salter. 

It was a booming Crochet spike 
off a Regal block that tied the con-
test at eight, and UCSD continued 
to press its momentum despite strong 
resistance from the Regals. The Tri-
tons notched big scores en route to a 
13-8 cushion, when Salter dumped 
a ball into the middle of the defense 
and then set for Biesheuvel - who 
cranked an outside ball through the 
block. This time, UCSD did not 
relinquish its lead, winning 15-10.

The Tritons have had a tough,

wanted it to end now. 

"We gave everything we

not be prouder of our team. Ei-
ther team that lost tbis one was 
going to be heartbroken." 

UCSD earned the opportu-
nity to play the highly ranked 
Cal Lutheran squad by stomp-
ing Occidental College in 
straight sets (15-9,15-11,15-6) 
on Friday night at RIMAC. The

UCSD was busy on the offen-
sive end as well , peppering 
Maurer with 11 more shots in the 
second half. One of those came 
after Ele Johnson swooped by a 
Monarch defender and found 
Amanda Johnson just waiting for 
the ball. Amanda made the most 
of the opportunity, burning a shot 
past Maurer in the lower left for 
the final score of the game. 

"[The Methodist playen] were 
real battlen, but we took control as 
the fint half went on," McManus 
said. "They came out strong in the 
second half, but we dominated af-
ter a few minutes. And the last 15, 
we put on a clinic." 

The victory was especially 
sweet for the sen ion, such as 
Muchowski. 

"Awesome is the only word 
to describe th is," Pugh said. 
"And gelling so close before, I 
think, makes it even belter." 

Ironically, it was a record-set-
ting, two-game losing streak ear-
lier this season that may have ce-
mented UCSO's championship. 

"After those losses, we had a 
meeting and just said that we 
never wanted to feel like that 
again. It was a reality check, and 
it brought us closer together," 
Pugh said: 

Along wi"th w inning the

step we had to get over." 

OUSTED: Cal Luth~ran topped host UCSD in 
four hard-fought sets to move on in the NCAAs 

The UCSD men's cross-country 
team overwhelmed the competition 
at Saturday's NCAA Division III 
Western Regionals with 
a dominating home-
course performance. By 
placing runners in five 
of the top six positions, 
UCSD convincingly 
claimed a spot at next 
week 's Division ((I Na-
tional Championships in 
La Crosse, Wisconsin. 

"We invited others to play at our 
place, and we showed control in our 
house," Head Coach Ted Van 
Arsdale said. "The men demon-
strated they ' re ready for Nationals." 

The Tritons' J. J. Castner won 
the regional race for the third year in 
a row, as he finished in 25:21 - an 
impressive 29 seconds ahead of 
teammate Goss Lindsey. However, 
that gap was much larger before 
Li ndsey made a surge in the late 
stages of the race. 

When asked why the margin 
shrunk, Castner replied, "I'd say 
mostly because I was alone. When I 
was running with [Lindsey] in the 
first mile, I felt really smooth. I 
could really feel his energy. But 
once we got into the trees and I 
pulled away, it got a little harder." 

Lindsey came in second, fol-
lowed by John Walsh - giving 
UCSD a one-two-three finish . 
Walsh's race was possibly the most 
exciting' of the day, as he dueled 

"[Allan] surged ahead of me 
through the tunnel; and when we 

were going along the 
stands, he kept looking 
back," Walsh said. 
"When they're looking 
back, you can tell that 
they ' re starting to hurt 
or they ' re worrying; so 
I knew I might have a 
little bit left to get him." 

Walsh did just that, 
using every last store of energy to 
sprint past Allan a~d finish third 
with a time of 26:02. 

The next 
racers across 
the finish line 
were Tritons 
Nate Johnson 
(26:14) and 
Bryan Leek 
(26:29). Their 
fi nishes se-
cured UCSD's 
team score of 
17 points -
only two 
points away 
from a com-
plete sweep. 

In the women's race, UCSD took 
fifth . Leading the team was Kyndra 
Smith, who finished 12th overall 
with a time of 19:54. With four of 
the seven women runners either 
freshmen or sophomores, it was a 
learning experience for the group. 

"I'm satisfied with the way the 
women came out ofit,"Van Arsdale 
said. "You always w,!nt to do better, 
but we' re very young. Our women 's 
team is where our men 's team was 
two years ago. It takes time to learn 
to com pete under pressure." 

Van Arsdale cited senior Jane 
Zimmerman 's 
third-place fin-
ish for the Tri-
tons (28th over-
all in 20:55) as 
an example. 

As Leek put 
it, "Anytime 
you score 17 
points, you 
know that you 
ran well as a 
team. We did

"[Zimmer-
man] has had to 
learn to com-

sure. This is 
what our 
younger 
women have to 
learn," he said. 
"I remind (the 
women] that if 
they have the 
desire, they'll 
get better. I'm 
aware that our

desire."

When the 32 teams begin the 
NCAA women 's volleyball tour-
nament, they all have the visions 
of a fairy-tale ending dancing in 
their heads. Unfortunately for 31 
of those teams, their 
seasons end in a less 
glorious fashion. On 
Saturday night, the 
Tritons' season came 
to a heartbreaking 
close, as they were de-
feated by archrival 
California Lutheran 
(25-2) in the NCAA 
Western Regional finals. 

After four, down-to-the-wire 
sets and nearly three hours of ac-
tion, the Regals escaped RIMAC 
Arena with the first regional cham-
pionship in their school's history. 

"That 's the best we've played," 
UCSD Head Coach Doug 
Dannevik said afterwards. "[But) 
Cal Lutheran was up to every chal-
lenge. They played great defense, 
and they got the ball to the right 
hitters. n

until the Tritons pulled ahead, 11-

momentum shifted quickly, how-
ever, when Cal Lutheran captured

Tritons Ascend to National Crown in New Jersey 
NUMBER 1: UCSD broke its NCAA dry spell by defeating Methodist College, 3-0, on Sunday to win the Division III title 
By orea Wrenn 
Contributing Sports Writer 

The monkey that had been 
hanging on the backs of the UCSD 
women 's soccer team disappeared 
very quickly in the shadow of the 
NCAA Division III Na-
tional Championship 
trophy the Tritons 
hoisted over New Jer-
sey yesterday. 

UCSD captured its 
second national crown 
since 1989 with a 3-0 
vanquishing of Meth-
odist College at Rich-
ard Stockton College in Pomona, 
New Jersey, after squeaking past 
William Smith College, 1-0, in 
Saturday's semifinal. 

It has been a long road back to 
the title for the Tritons (19-2), who 
have played in four straight Final 
Fours and five out of six since 
their first championship. After an 
unexplainable loss to Virginia 
three years ago - followed by a 
similarly baffling semifinal defeat 
at the hands of William Smith in 
1993 and a 4-3 sudden-death over-
time fall to Trenton State at home 
last year - UCSD was well on its 
way to establishing a reputation 
for making it big in the regular 
seaslh only to stumble in the games 
that really mattered. 

In addition to senior standouts 
Carin Pugh, AmandaJohnson, Car-
rie Peer, Kelly Kramer, Jennifer 
Ewert and Diana Muchowski -
who were determined to make the 

last oflheir collegiate soccer games 
worth remembering -the Tritons 
are a veteran team with as much 
Final Four experience as the other 
three teams combined. 

It was this experience factor 
which led the Tritons 
over William Smith (18-
2-\ )on Saturday. As has 
been the case for much 
of the season, UCSD 
took control of the con-
test early but was un-
able to capitalize on any 
scoring opportunities. 
Limited to only three 

comer kicks - their favorite offen-
sive weapon - for the entire game, 
the Tritons had to take their shots off 
Heron goalkeeper Suzanne Willard 
from a distance, but she was up to 
the task. 

In the meantime, the UCSD de-
fense - led by midfielders 
Amanda Johnson, Lauren Johnson 
and Brandie Hayungs-took con-
trol of its half of the field, limiting 
William Smith to four shots, with 
all but one of them coming from 
well outside the penally box. 

The Herons came out stronger 
in the second half, but so did the 
Tritons. Again, William Smith was 
limited to only one shot inside the 
penalty box - and that was just 
barely inside the top left comer-
while the only serious chance the 
team had was a 30-yard missile 
that caromed off the crossbar. The 
UCSD offense, on the other hand, 
made a habit of staying in Willard 's 

face. 
UCSD finally broke through 18-

and-a-half minutes after intermis-
sion, as a heavy rain began to turn 
the field into a swamp. Peer took 
the ball all the way down to the 
right corner, where she turned in-
side and fired a cross toward the 
mouth of the goal. 
Willard stepped 
out to make a play 
for it, but UCSD's 
Ele Johnson was 
also there and 
fought back, trap-
ping the ball in her 
stomach and then 
flicking it in forthe 
only score the Tri-
tons would need. 

grabbed by a Monarch defender 
just outside the penalty box. At 
first, Triton Lauren Johnson lined 
up for the direct free kick, but 
UCSD Head Coach Brian 
McManus called for Diana 
Muchowski to take it instead. 
Faced with a five-player Monarch 

The Tritons struck again only 
three minutes later off a nice piece 
ofleamwork - which started with 
Lauren Johnson lofting a pass to 
teammate Kelly Kramer, who was 
stationed at the left gQalpost. 
Kramer leaped and headed the ball 
backwards to Triton Beth 

Freeburg, who 
quickly buried the 
ball into the back 
of the net, giving 
UCSD a 2-0 lead. 

After the bailIe 
on Saturday, 
Sunday 's champi -
onship turned out 
to be somewhat 
anti-climactic . 
Methodist (18-4) 
had advanced to the 
final with a victory 
over host Richard 
Stockton on Satur-
day. While UCSD 
had struggled to 
convert scoring op-
portunities against 
William Smith, the 

. The Tritons 
kept the pressure 
on, launChing eight 
shots in the first 
half, while Meth-
odist tried to fight 
back by notching 
six of their own. 
But the second half 
was all UCSD, and 
the experienced 
Tritons completely 
shattered any 
comeback hopes 
with a stifling de-
fense and midfield 
- which shackled 
Methodist's attack 
and gave up only 
one shot after i n-
termission. 

"Our philoso-

phy is that when we 
have the ball, we have] ] attackers 
on the field - but when the other 
team has it, we have ] 1 defend-
ers," McManus said. "No single 

Tritons capitalized early in this 
game, forcing the Monarchs into a 
game of catch-up. 

Just ] 5:03 into the match, 
UCSD's Kelly Kramer was 

wall, Muchowski rifled the ball up 
and over, driving it into the upper 
right corner of the net- just past 
the outstretched arms of Method-
ist keeper Jen Maurer. See NUMBER 1, Page 17
