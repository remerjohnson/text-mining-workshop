DAVIS - Due to the 
Sacramento Symphony's 1996 
bankruptcy and a growing 
movement among UC Davis 
leaders to heighten the pres-
ence of the arts on campus and 
in the community, Chancellor 
Vanderhoef has revived a pro-
posal to establi sh a new sym-
phony orchestra at UCD to 
serve the Sacramento commu-
nity. The symphony would be 
housed at the new perfornling-
arts center on campus. which 
is scheduled to open in Jan. 
2002. As full -time uni versity 
employees, the 35 musicians 
would spend half of thei r time 
in r hearsal and performances. 
The other half would be spent 
teaching, conducting research 
and performing other music-
related tasks. The musicians 
would receive an annual sa lary 
of $40,000 plus benefits.

UCLA Faculty Urged 
To Aid In Funclralslng 
LOS ANGELES - UCLA 
Chancellor Albert Carnesale 
appealed to the Academic 
Senate Representative 
Assembly last Tuesday to take 
part in "Campaign UCLA," 
an ongoing fundraising pro-
gram. Carnesale told the 
assembly that UCLA needs 
donor money, citing statistics 
that the state of California 
provides UCLA with only 20 
percent of its operating bud-
get. In the tirst six months of 
thi s school year, fundraising 
totals have matched those of 
the entire last year - the 
largest fundrai sing year in 
UCLA history. "Campaign 
UCLA" has rai sed $550 mil -
lion since its creation and will 
most likely rai se $1 .2 billion 
by the year 200 I .

Claire Schneider/Guardian 
Honor: Katherine Korematsu placed the Medal of Freedom around her husband 's neck yesterday. 

AT 
Fred Korematsu comes to UCSD to discuss his historic Supreme Court case 

By Kara Carlos 
Staff Writer 

Fred Korematsll , a Japanese-
American internment activist, spoke 
Tuesday night about his imprison-
ment for resisting the 1942 Japanese 
internment orders of then-President 
Franklin Roosevelt. 

Korematsu was introduced by 
Peter Irons, attorney and UCSD 
political sc ience professor, who 
helped Koremat ·u re-open hi s case 
in 1983. 

After the bombing of Pearl 
.Harbor, an executi ve order was 
issued based on the military' fear of 

espionage. 
Korematsu was one of a handful 

of Japanese Americans who resisted 
the executive order, which ca lled for 
all Japanese Americans on the West 
Coast to evacuate their homes and 
report to internment camps. 

Korematsu said the government 
had a secret motive for evacuating 
the Japanese Americans. 

''They ju t wanted to take our 
land," Korematsu said. "They were 
jealous of how the Japanese were 
doing. They were even jealous of the 
nursery my family had." 

Born and rai sed in Oakland, 

Korematsu tried to enter the Army, 
but was rejected because of physical 
reasons. 

After Roosevelt issued the 
internment order, Korematsu under-
went facial surgery to appear as a 
Mexican American and went into 
hiding. 

Korematsu was working as a 
welder in San Leandro when he was 
arrested for defying the federal 
internment order. He was sent to a 
internment camp in Utah and spent 
five years on probation.

Clinton Announces $140 Million 'High Hopes' Grants 
INITIATIVE: Federal 
efforts mirror UC's 
new outreach program 
By Leena Shankar 
Associate News Editor 

President Bill Clinton intro-
duced the High Hopes initiative at a 
White House ceremony yesterday 
in a nationwide effort to attract and 
prepare low-income tudents for 
higher education. 

High Hopes will provide $140 

million in competitive grants 
toward forming partnerships ' 
between colleges, community 
groups and middle schools. These 
partnerships are designed to raise 
the expectations of young people 
and to encourage them to stay in 
school and attend co llege. 

"Our balanced budget for 1999 
includes $140 million to help these 
groups harness tbe power of citizen 
service and reach out to students, 
no later than the sevent~ grade, and 
work with them all the way to high 

school graduation," Clinton said. 
Clinton referred to his own 

background as an example of what 
he wants every chi ld to experience. 

"My family told me I was going 
to college, all my teachers told me I 
was going to college ... everybody 
told me I wa ' going to college," 
Clinton aid. "It never occurred to 
me that I wouldn 't go to college -
and yet, no o'.l~ in my family had 
ever been to college before. I wa 
in an environment that made it dif-
ficult for me to fail." 

Clinton added that this kind of 
effort is necessary for the health of 
the country. 

"In every community in thi!> 
country, there arc children with an 
enormous ability, who needju t a lit-
tle spark to go on to great things .... " 
Clinton said. "A great nation that 
aspires to even greater things in a 
new.century, in a new millennium, 
cannot afford to leave a singl' child 
behind. And we don' t intend to."

Scripps Oceanographer Wins 
Famed Hunt ..... Award 

Russ Davis, a professor of oceanography at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, has been awarded 
the 1997 A.G. Huntsman Award by the Bedford Institute 
of Oceanography in Canada. 

Davis' current research concerns the largest·scale 
circulation patterns In the ocean and their role in main-
taining the global climate. His studies are largely based 
on observations made by subsurface floating instru-
ments developed at Scripps. The Instruments allow 
oceanographers to observe the evolution of ocean tem-
perature and salinity In remote and harsh locations. 

The Huntsman award annually recognizes excellence 
in research and "those men and women, of any nation-
ality, who have had, and continue to have, a significant 
influence on the course of marine scientific thought." 

Huntsman winners receive an engraved silver medal 
and an invitation to present a distinguished lecture at 
the Dartmouth, Nova Scotia-based Bedford Institute. 

The Huntsman award was created to honor the mem-
ory of Archibald Gowanlock Huntsman, a pioneer 
Canadian oceanographer and fishery biologist.

Due to A~i a\ economic woes. inter-

he is worried that hi s parents may

Samuel Lee. director of the

"There is intense pressure to go

Heavy Rainfall Contributes to York Flood 
WATER: PPS crew

About a thousand gallons of

to lInclog a drain during Tuesday 
afternuon's heavy rain . 

Most of the water poured inlo

working was preparing chemicals 
for a laboratory dass.

However. the damage could 

have been much worse, and the, 
potential for any health hazards 
from mold is minimal , according to 

"The room has a fair amount of 
chemica ls in it, but nothing horren-

The only chemi-
cal that spilled into 
the surrounding 
water was about a

alcohol than in a

Though the

Wlnterfest Rocked UCSD 
and United the Campus 

UCSD's first annual Winterfest is in the books, 
and what u smashing success it was. Approximately 
3,000 UCSD siuden is and the ir friends danced the ir 
tail s off to Goldfish, Dance Hall Crashers and the 
swingin' sounds of Big Bad Vo doo Daddy. 

Winterfest is a great idea. Every year, it see ms 
that the Sun God Festival is the only time in which 
the UCSD com munity co mes ou t in droves. To 
boot , ~ LUden t s' school spirit and pride is raisetlto 
an a ll -time hi g h outside of s porting events. Now, . 
with Winte rfes t, we have a winter version of Sun 
G d. 

Vice hancellor of Student Affairs Joe Watson , 
A .S . President Sou ley Diallo and A.S . Programmer 
Kathy Lee are now di 'cuss ing the possible imple-
mentation of a fall festival as well. Lee has been 

. pu.-hing for thi s third annual festival for quite some 
time. 

Sun God is a monumental success evelY year, and 
the Winterfest turnout proved that UCSD is anxious 
for more exciting and more frequent on-campus fes-
tivals. We wholeheartedly support Lee's idea for a 
fall fest ival. 

Having one festival each quarter would g reatly 
improve UCSD's social scene, as well as appease 
many of those who expressed dissatisfaction in the 
Campus Quality of Student Life survey. 

Elimination of Indicator 
Limits Student Awareness 

Last fall , the University Center's Advisory Board 
issued the New Indica /or an eviction notice, a death-
sentence to UCSD's original student-run newspaper. 

The disappearance of yet another campus publica-
ti o n is a tragedy for all students and o thers associat-
ed with the university - and the Nell' Illdic{//or isn't 
the first newspaper to disappear. 

We once had a myriad of stude nt publications 
strewn about campu s, spouting view~ from every end 
of the politi cal spec trum . In recent years , however, 
the campus has los t man y of those puhlications, and 
with them diminished the opportu nities for students 
to be heard . 

Campus newspLipers and magazi nes provide stu-
denls Ihe o pportunity to voice their opinions . One 
less publicalion is one less ven'lIe for sLUdenl. to 
openly discuss pressing isslies. 

As the current o ffi c ial campus publication, the 
Gllardiall stri ves to provide readers a forum in which 
10 publicize views important to them . Unfortumllely, 
we cannot accomplish this task alone. It is the refore 
detrimental to UCSD that yet another student publi -
cation has died - the deve lopment of a more social-

FIGHTING THE IRON FIST OF 
THE UCSD BICYCLE COP 

COMMENTARY: Student's run-in with the law 'exemplifies the pettiness of 
bureaucracy, but the writer employs his creativity to turn the tables around 
By Mark Smith 
Staff Writer 

What is the deal with Ihat bicycle 
police officer? 

You know the onc I' m ta lking 
ahou!. He's the guy who stands on 
Lihrary Walk , just wailing for a bicy-
de rider to get off hi s bike on.: second 
too late. He 's the guy sianding ncxlto 
his pimped-oul bi cyc le, peering 
through hi s ~ungfasses al each pa~scr­
by near Urey Hall . 

For the majori lY of y u, you arc 
probahly fed up with thi s guy handing 
out bicycle speeding ticket s. However, 
for the rcmaind r of Ihe ~tudcl1 t hody 
who lIlay think lhi~ guy's nol so bad, 
I've gal someth ing 10 tell you. That 's 
ri ghi, I have lirst-hand inrormation 
revealing lhe dark side or our friend , 
the ticketing tyrant. Mcntally, th b guy 
is unhealthy - at best. 

About midway lhrough freshman 
year, my bike, which I have had since 
the eighth grade, was bcgi nning to 
feellhc burden of its years. This thing 
looked like one of lhose 10-speed 
rust-ridden bikes you sec locked in 
the same place all year. I also nOliced 
a pallern in my tardiness to ellrfy 
morning classes. J figured I nel.:ded to 
shave ofT s;)me va luable bed-IO-class 
time. 

I had alreauy made it a policy thm 
getting off my bike to cross the 10-
rool-wide Library Walk W(lS ridicu-

l ou~, so I needed to cuI my time else-
when:. While locki ng my bike one 
morning, I laughed at myself. Who in 
their righl mind would steal my pieee-
of-crap bike'! I mean, you couldn 't 
even sell il for scrap. 

I looked around, trying 10 lind a 
pOlential thief in the crowd. I lhen . 
made my decision - I would no 
Ion 'er lock my hike. Not onl would 
thi~ ~par.: me the 30 to 40 ecunds il 

Early In the spring 
quarter, I got bored. 
In case you didn't

me to build stuff.

engine on my bike.

decrease the weight I had· lo carry by 
leaving my lock al horne would, 
which , in turn, wou ld decre.lse my 
commute timc. 

I continued operating under thi s 
policy all lhroughout the winter quar-
ter. 0 one moved my bike 0 11 e. One 
faleful :wring-quarter morning, how-
ever, the incvitable happened - my 
hike was siolen. 

I had parked it in the racks right 
outside Harlan Hall , my dorm, and 
when I came OUl, it was g ne! Boy, 
was I pissed - nol Occaus.: I had lost 
sorn~ great monetary treasure, but 
because I now had to walk to class, 

Silting al horne the nexi day, nurs-
ing my overworked ca lvc~ from my 
three trips to and rrom YorJ.. frickin' 

Hall, I heard the phone ring. It was our 
good friend the bike cop! 

Luckily, in a fit of freshman fervor, 
1 had registered my hike during fall 
quarter. He said my bike was al the 
Transrorlation Alternatives ofllce and 
that 1 could pick it up. I walked uver 
and fl ashed lhem my sludeml.D. card. 
Dumbfounded that the system had 
'actually worked in my favor, I asked 
the hike cop where he Inrd found my 
bike. 

"Right in the hike racks at Warren," 
he responded. Curious, I thought , 

lhat ' ~ righl where I lefl it. 
"So, why did you lake itT' I asked, 

a lillie bit perturbed. 
He replied very maller-of-ractly : he 

had taken it because it was unlocked l 
"You stole my bike! Gimmc it 

back!" I retorted. 
I was then told that it would COSl 

me $ 10 lO get it oUl of storage. 
"Let me gel lhis slraighl," 1 said. 

"You steal my bike just because it's 
unlocked, and then want me to pay 
you $10 for it? Thal's robbery! I want 
my bike back! " 

He t hen told me that [ had ahan-
doned my bike for the lime in which I 
had left it unlocked in the rack. 

"No. I didn'l," I said . "I trusted the 
student body not to steal it, and 111ey 
didn ' l. The rolice did. What if you 
accidenlally left your car unlocked and 
the keys inside. Cou lJ I lake il and 
claim you abandoned itT' 

Of course, the bike cop lold me that 
was a different situation - bikes arc 
bikes and cars are cars. Yel. he still 
insist on handing ou t "traffic viola-
tions" to bil.:yclers on Library Walk.

Psycho Therapy 
A Discussion· of Public Nudity: Second in A Two-Part Series 
By Mary Higgins Senior Staff Writer 
"Not A Licensed Therapist" 

My Black's Beach, soul-search-
ing days are pretty much over. 

r never thought the "naked peo-
ple" issue would escalate beyond 
minor discomfort . 1 ligured lhal if 
some people feel more liberaled by 
removing all of their clothes, then

business. 

And Ihen two weeks ago I was 
approached for the first time. 

I was hiking down to the beach 
from the Glider Port - no trivial 
feat, since reeeill rainfall had al\ but 
washed away the lrail. 

As I scrambled down the rocks, 
1 mel a miln corning loward me. I 
lowered my eyes to a void encour-
aging conversation. Then I realized 
that, although he was fully clothed, 
he seemed to have forgotten about

playing in the surf, I didn't see 
them. 

h 's really palhetic Ihat a jerk 
could ruin my day like that. I don 'l 
care so much thai he was naked. 
What bothers me is lhat he lried to 
use it against me as a weapon, and 
it worked. ' 

That's my gripe about Black 's 
Beach . II lends to attract not only 
the "Iiberaled" nudists, bUl also 
lonely, psycholie jerks who have 
mastered the art of inlimidation. 

I think these "naked people" feel 
they need to make a point. Maybe 
they're proud of their body. Maybe 
all they want is a lillie <llIention. Or 
maybe lhey' re jusl sick. 

A couple years ago, you may 
recall that UC Berkeley was home 
to the so-called "Naked Man." This 
guy was really proud of himself. 

For a lillie while, the case illude 

national headlines - I remember 
hi s classmates being interviewed 
on TV. I guess the "Naked Man" 
thoughl he was making a bold 
social statement by attending fall 
semester lectures in the buff. 

I wanted to laugh when winter 
rolled around and suddenly Ihe 
"Naked Man" vanished from sight. 
My guess is that he discovered 
Northern California can get pretty 
chilly in December. There are parts 
of the human body which one 
would prefer not to lose to frost-
bite, if you know what I mean. 

or course, if the "Naked Man" 
lived in La Jolla, he could just slip 
on a tee-shirl.

to open the storage bin - just to 
retrieve the lock. 

Unable to light the bike cop sin-
gle-handedly, and unaware of the 
Student Ad vocates Office as a 
freshman , I left my bike in storage 
to contemplate whether it was 
wonh $10. After a month of walk-
ing around campus, I de<.: idcd that 
my bike was a necessity and forked 
over the 10 bu<.:ks, but not without 
a little more well-deserved harass-
ment. 

I remai ned steadfast in my 
devotion to the no- Io<.:k poli<.:y, 
What I nceded was a lightweight 
lock that was qui<.:k to put on and 
take otT. Arter poring over the 
newest issue of Locks - A 
Maga zine jor the Paranoid, it came 
to me. A piece of ribbon! 

Technically, anything att aching 
my bike to the stand was clJnsid-

ered a lock. I could easi ly tie a rib-
bon around my bike, and just as 
easily come out of dass and rip 
out of the park ing lot of bicycles 
unfettered by the trouble of an 
actual lock. Although I did get 
some ugly looks from our corrupt 
bike cop, my bicycle was safe -
for now. 

Early in the spring quarte r, I got 
bored. In case you didn' t read my 
first arti cle, boredom usuall y 
means it 's time for me to build 
stuff. I decided to put an engine on 
my hike. 

r made my weekly trip to Home 
Depot and walked straight to power 
too l all ey. [ found a used chainsaw 
for $80 and lOok it home. After 
removing the blade, I had a nice lit -
tle engine to power my bike. To 
connect it , I drilled some holes into 
my frame and bolted the engi ne on. 
I tuok the centripetal clutch off and 
went to the bike store. 

I found a small cog to fit over 
the clutch and visited Convoy to 
we.ld it on. [ found a guy who 
would do it under the counter for

$10. I got an eXIra chain, sawed off 
my petals and connected the 
engine. During my first trial run , I 
decided that I needed a ~maller rear 
wheel. After the modification, I had 
my fri ends time me from Harlan 
Hall to AP&M and back - four 
minutes fl at. 

About a week later, I was 
~ topped at the corner of Equality 
and Voigt. I was wamed by a rcal 
cop that if I was going to ride a 
"motorcycle" I needed to wear a 
helmet. I agreed. I thanked him and 
took off. 

Another week passed and I 
received a letter from the Warren 
Residential Life office stating that I 
needed 10 get rid of my "motorcy-
cle." I understood their concern , 
took the engi ne otT, rehuilt the 
chainsaw and sold it fo r $80. 

[ walked my bike (no pedals) on 
over to Transp,ortation Allernati ves 

. (homebase to our friend, the bi ke 
cop) and left it in their bike rack, 
unlocked. It was gone in an hour. r

"Since I entered college I've 
been on the big identity search. 
W ho am I? W hat's my purpose? 
Where am I going? . 

But, there was one question I 
never wanted to ask. The one 
about my Jewish identity. It simply 
didn't interest me. 

So, last year around this time I 
met a guy. He had depth, 
intellect, and a warm, embracing 
soul. He t old me about this place 
w ith mountains and forests, 
horses and hiking trails outside 
LA where he had spent nearly 
four weeks during the previous 
summer. He said it had changed 
his life, awakened his intellect and 
his jewish soul. I thought. 'no 
thanks, not for me.' 

Then I realized I was envious 
of what he seemed to have. So I 
did something I swore I'd never 
do. I went. And it was the best 
thing I ever did. I met other 
people just like me. We all shared 
an experience so deep and 
meaningful I can't imagine we will 
ever be out of contact w ith one 
another.

When students gathered at 
York Hall 2622 for Professor 
Kenneth Intriligator's Physics 2C 
class late Tuesday afternoon, they 
found the floor of the lecture hall 
covered with about an inch and a 
half of water, thanks to the broken 
water pipe. 

However, the professor went 
on with the class. He even man-
aged to use the soggy circum-
stances to his advantage by tap-
ping his foot in the water to 
demonstrate wave motion. 

"I held the class, bUI my feet

When InLriligator returned to the

"I laid there and thought maybe 
I should have stayed in jail," 
Korematsu said. "The sanitation 
was terrible in the internmeni 
camps. There was a diarrhea epi-
demic almost every day." 

AI a reception held yesterday in 
the Cross Cultura 1 Center, one stu-

ca e hclped bring abo ul an official 
apology from Ihe U.S. gov.:rnment, 
and the payment of $20,000 to cm;h

Irons spoke of the milestone 
that was accomplished. 

"I don ' I think any of this would 
have happened without Fred taking 
a stand," Irons said. " It challenged 
the issue of Japanese internment 
itself, and his constituti onal 
rights." 

On Jan. IS, President Clinlon 
honored Korematsu in the East

parenls lived in the 
internment camps 
commented on the 
hardsh i ps they 
faced. 

"The gove'rn -

Korematsu said. "None of us 
should be ashamed of who we are , 
and never be afraid to speak out." 

Most students viewed 
Korematsu as a hero in the eyes of 
justice. 

"I really admire him because he 
was an average guy who stood up 
for what he had been taught his 
whole life , that all Americans have 
equal rights," said Marshall junior 
Dawn Clabcaux. 

Despite the ill treatment that 
Korematsu received at the hands 
of the government, he was able to 
forgive the past injusti ces. When

Korematsu said. "I excuse them

PRIMUS: 
Weirdness is their 
claim to fame 
ContInued frOlll ...... 
well . for instance "Too Many Pup-
pies." "My Name is Mud" and 
"Southbound Pachyderm." 

"People always ask Les. 
'Where do you come up with your 
lyrics"'" Brain said. "The truth is, 
we don' t even reall y think about 
it. " 

Half of Primus' songs are based 
on the band 's inside jokes. "S hake 
Hands With Beef." for instance, 
the first si ngle from The Brown 
Album. is nothing but a munchie 
story. 

The band was looking for 
nourishment afte r a long day of 
snowboarding when they came 
across the always- favored Taco 
Bell. La Lond e. who is, of course. 
trying to eat better in hi s thirty-
something years. thought other-
wi se. and told Brain and Clay-
poo l. "[ don' t know if I can shake 
hands with beef." 

Personal habits aside. many of 
Primus' inspi rations seem to come 
from greasy food, as is evide m;ed 
by many of their album titl es: Friz-
zle Fry ( 1990). Pork Soda ( \ 993) 
and Ta les From rhe Punchbowl 
( 1995). 

"Growing up in a subu rban 
atmosphere. we'd all eat fast food." 
Brain sa id. "Les wou ld think, 
'That's pretty funny. I'm going to 
write a song about that. ". 

Claypool is the brainchild of the 
weirdes t band thi s side of Gwar. 
Usually class ica lly attired at li ve 
shows. he can often be found lead-
ing the c rowd in a rousing chant of 
"Primus sucks." 

Clay pool is also the man who 
had the band dress up in penguin 
suit s for a 1995 appearance on 
"The Late Show Wilh David Letter-
man." 

"[LesJ kind of reminds me of a 
cartoon character." Brain said. "his 
look. hi s voice. I think kids latch 
onto that the same way they latch 
onto a cool cartoon." 

Oddly enough. a cool ca rtoon 
latched onto Primus. The theme 
song for the hugely successfu l 
"South Park" was penned and per-
formed by the band. Malt Stone 
and Trey Parker. creators of 
"South Park." are huge Primus 
fans . 

'They sent us 'The Spiri t of 
Christma • and we- thought . 'Thi s is 
the grea test thing we've ever 
seen ... · Brain sa id. 

Primus now li ve in "South 
Park" infamy. Claypool even 
appears. albeit crudely animated, 
playi ng bass and singing in the 
show's opening sequence. 

Today. the band is reaping the 
benefit s of The Brown Album. 
Brain is in his second year with the 
band after the departure of original 
Primus drummer Tim "Herb" 
Alexander. 

Whereas Alexander used hi 
huge drumset to add trebled fill s 
and off-k ilter rhythm '. Brain is 
more stra ight ahead - he says his 
style is somewhere be tween Keith 
Moon and John Bonham. Sure 
eno ugh. The BrowlI Album is 
laden wi th Led Zeppelin influ-
ences. 

"We said. 'Let's do someth ing 
complete ly opposit e fro m what 
Primus is doing ... ' Brain sa id. 
'''Let's go crazl Let's try to make 
it ound as heavy as possible.' I like 
it because we went for something

Just Singing In.the Rain 
Rolling Stones give audience devilishly good time at Oua/com m 

By Bill Glanzman" 
Senior Staff Writer 

Provi ng all the- l: riti cs who 
cynica ll y dubbed their tour the 
"Geezers ' Tour" or the "Geritol 
Jam" wrong. Mick Jagger and the 
rest of the Rolling Stones blazed 
through an explos ive and freneti c 
two- hour se t without mi ssi ng a 
single beat. 

Performin g nea rly non-stop 
wi th a see mingly inex haustible 
store of energy that would put 
many yo unger bands to shame, 
The Stones showed an almos t-full 
stad ium of screaming fans that 
when you stan th em up, they 
never stop. 

Amid dissipating mist. tl ashing 
strobe lights and surrealistic deep-
blue illu mi nation. The Stones took 
the stage in an in ferno of energy 
that catapulted them into a bli ster-
ing rendi ti on of "Satisfal:ti on." 

Without even a small breather. 
they made a no-holds-barred segue 
into an equally energeti c and over-
the-lOp perfoflnance of "Let's 
Spend the Night Together." whip-
pi ng the spectators into a virt ual 
frenzy of sl:rea ming. shouting and 
dancing. 

Enh anci ng the spectacle was 
an enormous stage fil led with a 
host of pyrotec hnics (leapi ng bon-
fi res . fi rework s and shooting 
sparks) and spec ial -effec ts light -
ing. Added to this was go lden 
architec tu re reminiscent of 
ancient Bahylon to promote The 
Stones' new album. Bridges to 
Babyloll . 

In the center of the stage was a 
huge. mirror-like screen that alter-
nately cJisplayed each member of 
the band while in concert along 
with a few scenes cut from several 
music videos. Tnle to form. this 
gian t screen was nankcd by two 
immense golden statues of com-
plete ly nude women wi th sensuous 
expressions who were provocative-
ly bent over.

Jagge r's bandmates also held 
their own as Keith Richards ' crisp. 
blues-inspired guitar riffs perfectly 
complemented Charlie Watts' deep. 
thundering beats. An ex~ra addition 
of brass instruments. including 
trombone. trum pet and saxophone. 
were welcome supplements that 
ga ve the music a richer texture and 
resonance. 

Surp ri singly. The Stones played 
onl y two song fro m thei r new 
album. including a frenzied "Out of 
Control" and "Saint of Me," 
Instead. they relied on their old hit s 
for most of the concert. 

It was no surprise that these old 
songs werc well-recei ved and 
shook the whole stad ium. These 
songs ranged fro m the electr ic 
intensi ty of "Hanky Tank Women" 
and "Start Me Up" to the explosive 
" Brown Sugar" in a powerful . rain-
soaked finale. 

When all is said and done. the 

Rolling Stones proved yet again 
that old age can't stop them from 
being one of the best rock 'n' roll 
bands in the world. 

The evening got off to a good 
start with Ca rlos Santana opening 
the show. He wasted no time in get-
ting the crowd into the right 
groove. 

Hunched over his guitar and 
completely absorbed by the music. 
Santana performed such perpetual-
ly sat isfyi ng stap les as " Black 
Magic Woman" and "Oye Como 
Va." Sa nt ana elici ted a very posi-
tive response fro m the audience 
and made more than a few grand-
mothers leave thei r scats to do a lit-
tle hip-swi veling. 

Al though his cx tended jams 
combined wi th hypnotic Latin 
rhythms never failed to please. 
Sant ana seemed somewhat sub-
dued and left after a short 40-

How Far Would You GO?- Hang 'Em On the Rack 
'Desperate Measures' tackles moral issues Spice World'fails to exceed low expectations 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

II is the question that comes up again and 
again in Hollywood: "How far would you go 
to save someone you lover' In "Desperate 
Measures," the question is: "How far would 
you go to save your son's life?" 

Police otlicer Frank Connor (Andy Garcia) 
would go fairly far, His son needs bone-mar-
row transplants, and he needs them in a hurry. 
Connor finds a match. but it is with convicted 
killer Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton), a dia-
bolical criminal who is not inclined to part 
with his bone marrow to help a cop's kid. 

McCabe has a surprise cliange of heart 
and agrees to donate the precious marrow, 
but only if Connor gets the warden to rein-
state privileges that McCabe lost because of 
bad behavior. In a surprisc equal to the first 
one, McCabe uses these privileges to formu-
late an escape plan. . 

McCabe succeeds in freeing himself and 
begins to run amok in the hospital. The 
moral dilemma for Connor is that if McCabe 
is killed, his marrow becomes poisoned and 
is useless to save the life of his little boy. 

Connor finds himself working at odds 
with his colleagues, and gets several of them 
killed as he desperately tries to preserve the 
life of his son's perfect DNA match. 

The whole "you can ' t kill me if you want 
your son to Ii ve" angle gets tiresome after 
awhile, especially as it is the linchpin of sev-
eral showdown scenes. Connor finally fig-
ures out how to resolve the situation with a 
thought so obvious that it must have 
occurred 10 most of the audience during the 
initial confrontation. 

Superficially, the dilemma in this fi 1m 
resembles the one in the similarly titled film 
from last year, "Extreme Measures," where 
Gene Hackman performed experiments on 
humans in an effort to find a cure for 
quadra- and paraplegics. 

'However, in this movie it is the hero who 
is pushing the ethics envelope and his only 
interest is in saving his own son, not human-
ity. The father/son interactions are touching, 
and Joseph Cross gives an excellent perfor-
mance as the young son, Matt Connor. 

Overall, the movie is just a little too pre-
dictable for an action thriller. and the con-
stant use of the "you can ' t kill mc" thing 
drags the film down a bit. The actors tum in 
good, but not outstanding. performances. 
specifically Keaton and Garcia. 

"Desperate Measures" offers slightly 
above-average entertainment value to an 
overused moral dilemma to produce an 
"alright" movic. 

By Chris Schreiber 
Senior Staff Writer 

Anyone for tea and strumpets, er, crum-
pets? If so, go check out the new Spice Girls 
movie, "Spice World," the best movie most 
l3-year-old girls have ever seen, Of course, 
their young ages do not allow them a broad 
base against which to (;ompare this cinemat-
ic masterpiece, but that is of little concern. 

The best thing about this movie is that it 
has, like, all five Spice Girls on, like, all the 
time - like, oh my God, they are so cute. 
Sporty Spice wears sporty outfits, and Baby 
Spice wears cute linle baby stuff. It rules. 
The funniest part is when they all dress in 
each others' clothes. Imagine, Ginger Spice 
wearing Baby Spice outfits. The five-girl 
British cheesecake review produces a self-
conscious comedy that tries ' to fuse Monty 
Python-esque British dry wit with American 
pop-culture cinematic references and a little 
fake Spice Girl history. 

Oh yeah, and they throw in a little mes-
sage about the importance of friendship and 
the true meaning of girl power to make it a 
movie that mailers. Knowing that their main 
fan demographic, 13- to 16-year-old girls, 
are just entering the world of raging hor-
mones. and truly believing in girl power and 
equality, the Spice Girls add a little equal-

opportunity beefcake in one of the scenes, 
with bare-chested Italian dancing boys com-
plementing the dancing Spices. 

Of course, the Spice Girls protest the 
tackiness of their boy toys' outfits, and a 
compromise is reached: pink leather tuxedos 
with air vents where the butt covers normal-
ly reside. A guy's gona get some air, you 
know. You go, girls! 

With scenes parodying "Rocky," "Close 
Encounters of the Third Kind" and "Pulp 
Fiction," among other American cinematic 

' classics, alongside Roger Moore poking 
some fun at his old James Bond days, the 
movie does have a few amusing moments , 

A(;tually, if you enjoy laughing heartily at 
extremely inane things that someone, some-
where, took very seriously, then this movie 
really is for you. On that level, the only thing 
consistently more hilarious are the "Letters to 
the Editor" in this fine publication. 

If you want to see this movie just to sat-
isfy your curiosity, catch the matinee. The 
Spice Girls are cute, but not cute enough to 
pay full price. You will also have the theater 
to yourself as junior high is still in session. 
If you are lucky. no one you know will see 
you buy your ticket. As for me, I'm going to 
go look up those pictures of Ginger Spi ce on 
the Internet again. She's so unencumbered.

Levert Sweat Gill 

-
-.. '*.* 

Many R&B enthusiasts are 
familiar with the names Gerald 
Leven, Keith Sweat and Johnny 
Gill. These singers have had their 
successes in the past and are ready 
to advance to a whole new level in 
the R&B genre. 

Meshing their talents, these 
anists combine forces to form the 

singing trio LSG. Their debut 
album, off the Elektra label, is enti-
tled Levert Sweat Gill. 

LSG put forth a masterful com-
pilation of soulful ballads, sprin-
kled with a few up-tempo party 
tracks. The Lox, ID, LL Cool 1, 
Busta Rhymes, MC Lyte and 
lazze Pha all get in on the party 
act. but don't let the big names 
fool you. Despite these artists' 
outstanding cameo appearances, 
the album gains fame from its 
romantic side. 

Hardcore R&B fans will not be 
disappointed by LSG's smooth and 
amorous verses. 

"Door Itl," the album's first 
track, draws listeners in as the trio 
shows that their individual styles 
can blend together well, while 
sri II remaining strong during 
solos. 

"Round & Round" offers a coy, 
playful atmosphere of romance 
with a chorus such as, "Round and 
round we go/where we gonna stop 
nobody has to know." 

LSG convey a tone of reminis-
cence and romance in the song "All 
The Times," featuring Faith Evans, 
Coko from SWV and Missy Elliot. 

An apologetic mood that is 
fail-safe with any loved one per-
meates through "My Side Of The 
Bed ." 

With the addition of the steamy 
hit single "My Body," LSG capture 
the emotions of love, passion and 
lust in one 'of the album 's stronger 
tracks. 

R&B fans worldwide will be 
on the edge of their seats waiting 
for this powerful trio's next 
effort. •

PRIMUS: 
Telling them they 
suck is a compliment 
Continued frOlll ..... 10 
road." 

Now, however, Primus are 
switching gears. The band will be 
releasing an EP this spring. Like 
its last EP. MisceLlaneous Debris 
(1992), this one will be entirely 
comprised of cover songs. Defi-
nites include tracks originally 
recorded by The Police, Metalli -
ca, Peter Gabriel and others. 
Brain even hints at the possibility 
of including the "South Park" 
theme song. 

Primus' claim to fame is their 
live shows; they pride themselves 
on their weirdness. No strangers 
to the live scene, Primus paid 
their dues as every band's favorite 
live act. The band has opened for 

Thursday, February 5, 1998 

the likes of The Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, Jane's Addiction, Rush, 
U2, Neil Young and countless 
others. 

Primus are also one of the 
only bands who have toured with 
both Perry Farrell 's Lollapalooza 
and lohn Popper's HORDE 
tours, in 1993 and 1997 respec-
tively. 

Now, Primus headline Sno-
Core, the music tour for snow-
boarders. Normally filled with 
punk rock and ska acts, Sno-Core 
marks another endeavor for 
Primus into the realm of bands 
that sound nothing like them -
kind of like the surprise guest 
your family did not invite to din-
ner. Primus wouldn't have it any 
other way. 

So batten down the hatches. 
Primus are coming to your town 
and there's nothing you can do to 
stop them.

Drug Study. All testing and study

'Blues Brothers 2000' Makes a Sweet-Sounding Sequel 

Dan Aykroyd and John Goodman bring the band together once more for a toe-tappin' good time 
By Ryan Olson 
Senior Staff Writer 

The mission from God that sent 
Jake and Elwood Blues on a wi ld 
trip through Illinois in the original 
"Blues Brothers" ~ontinues in its 
sequel, "Blue~ Brothers 2000." 

The original cult-classic spun 
off the wi ldly su c~essful House of 
Blues chain of nightclubs and 
numerous recordings. The movie 
left an indelible mark on the musi -
cal land cape. 

"Blues Brothers 2000" hark s 
bal.:k to the original movie. The 
movie is dedicated to John Belushi, 
Cab Calloway and John Candy -
stars that passed away in the inter-
im. There are also several inside 
jokes that wi II thri ll any fan of the 
original. 

The trongest feature of "Blues 
Brothers 2000" is the music; very 
few minutes typically pass before 
they launch into another song. 

The musical talent in the movie 
is outstanding. The stand-out group 
of brilliant musicians include old 
favorites such as B.B. King, James 
Brown, Aretha Franklin and Bo 
Diddley. The film also features a 
new generation of musicians that 
includes Erykah Badu, Johnny 
Lang and Blues Traveler. Of 
course, to 'forget the Blues Brothers 
Band would be a sin. 

Music Director Paul Shaffer 

must be given credit for casting the 
more than 40 musicians. The actual 
music is excellent and is the best 
part of the lilm. It 's a shame that all 
the musicians couldn ' t be show-
cased. 

The songs rhat arc performed in 
this film are nothing short of out-
standing. Of course. there is nothing 
that can top the Blues' dancing sty le. 

For those that care about the 
razor-thin plot, "Blues Brothers 
2000" foc~ses on the life of 
Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) after 
he is released from prison - 18 
years after the Blues Brothers' last 
gig. Elwood discovers that lake 
(Belushi) has passed away. 

Now alone in the worJd, Elwood 
mu tt ry to lind a new family. Con-
veniently, hi s new "family" appears 
in the next five minutes in the form 
of the orphan BUSIer (J. Evan Boni-
fant) and the straight-as-an-arrow 
police officer Cabel Chamberlin 
(Joe Morton). Cabel is the illegiti-
mate son of Curtis (Calloway), 
Elwood's old mentor. 

Elwood's ultimate goal is to get 
the band together after an 18-year 
eparation. The group slart s off in a 

"stripster club" where they pick up 
bartender Mighty Mack McTeer 
(John Goodman) as the group's 
new lead singer. The film ends with 
a battle of the bands in the bayous 
of Louisiana.

TODAY'S CHECKLIST: 

Courtesy of Universal Pictures 
Brothers: Dan Aykroyd (left) , J. Evan Bonifont and John Goodman get down with the sweet sounds of 
the gospel from the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown) in "Blues Brothers 2000.· 

Along the way, the band runs 
into the Russian mob, a redneck 
militia and a lot of old fri ends that 
add spice to the movie. 

Sadly, the weakest link in this 
movie is the plot. Whereas the plot 
in the original seemed like four 
fried chickens and a Coke, the plot 
in "Blues Brothers 2000" seems 
like two pieces of white bread -

adequate, b'ut not really satisfying. 
It appears that Aykroyd and 

director/writer John Landis threw 
in a skeleton of a plot to link 
musical numbers together. Char-
acters do things in the movie 
without much explanation or rea-
son . 

Of course, that is not to say that 
the movie doesn't have funny lines 

- it does, but not with the consis-
tently funny zip that the original 
did . . 

The music and the energy this 
movie exhibits is undeniable. The 
plot seems to be the only weak 
point in the movie, and the only 
thing that prohibits the viewer 
from having a truly enjoyable 
time.

,For The Tritons, The Hits Keep On Comin' 
'CONFIDENCE: UCSD executed all night and dispatched a taller Southern Cal College team, 91-78 
By Jeff Bassett 
Staff Writer 

There is only one word which 
accurately describes the UCSD 
women's basketball team ri ght 
now, and the word is hUllcr.

relc rence here is 
not (0 Ch k k

and delinitely 
not to the "1

dairy substitute. 

The bUllcr is 
Pennsylvania Dut(;h churn-style, 
spreadable and smooth . 

Why butter? As ESPN 's play-
ground legend Stuart S(;OIl would 
say, "you gotta bc buller when 
you're on thi s kinda roll." 

Tuesday night the .women'l;. 
team won its ninth straight contest, 
91-7& over Southern California 
College. 

Tbat 's right, the streak ha now 
reached nine. No mailer how one 
might sli(;c it, dice it, or more 
appropriately spread it, a winning 
streak of nine is impressive. 

However, Tuesday. night was 
different. This was I)ot t1w usual 
blowout, the aJl-too-common 38-
point win. '{he margin of vi(;tory 
was on,lyd3 points.

consecutive wins. As if that wasn' t 
enough, this squad was physically 
huge. SouOlern California dressed 
three women above 6-feet-tall , 
including one at a legitimate 6-
foot-4. 

The iJ1\ensity that would per-
meate thi s gqme could be sensed 
and. seen from the outset. There 
were few pre-game smiles, no 
nonchalance or pleasantries . . 

The fi rst half was a good, old-
fashioned slugfest, as each team 
responded to the other's allempts 
to apply an early knockout blow. 

Southern California led until 
. Lhe 10-minute mark, when Amy 
Franzen's jumper. followed by 
Amy McClure's three-pointer, 
evened the score at 19. 

The Tritons proceeded·to go on 
a 15-6 run, propellcd by the effort s 

of ~e ni or Kri sta Poel]ler. Poehler 
converted her own steal into an 
uncontested layup, and subse-
quently drained her allempt from

UCSD Feeling Effects Of Tough Division I Schedule 
ANTEATE'RS: UC Irvine took advantage of a tired Triton squad, extending its losing streak to five 
By Steve Walsh 
Senior Staff Writer 

Sometimes it just isn't easy bcing a power-
house Division III school. Just ask the UCSD 
men's volleyhalltcam. 

The majority of UCSD sport s 
teams are able to light through sched-
ules of Division III and NAIA institu-
tions with the occasional foray into the 
rea lm of Divis ion 11. 

The Triton men's volleyball squad, 
howevcr, finds it se lf in the middle of 
I he best Division I volleyball confer-
ence in the nation. the Mountain Pacif-
ic Sports Federation. 

With this in mind, il should he taken with a 
grain of suit that the Tritons entered their match 
against UC Irvine on a four-match losing 
streak . Each of the last four opponents were 

ranked in the top 20 in the nation. and one, 
Stanford, was the defending National Champi-
on. 

. As is the case with the majority of it s Divi-
sion r opponents, UCI made full use of its size 

advantage on the frontline, out-block-
ing the Tritons 13-7 on its way to a 15-
13 game one victory . . 

For as well as UCSD played in the 
first game, the Tri tons hit a major 
tumbling block in the second game. 

That stumbling block came in the 
form of Anteater standout Cory 
Weber, 

Weber proved to be nearly unstop-
pable on both offense and defense against the 
Tri t ns. Wehcr racked up 24 kills and 6 blocks. 
both highs for the match. With Weber and the 
re ·t of the UCI attack playing nearly flawles.~ 

volleyball . the Tritons could do littlc to respond 
and dropped the second game, 15-2. 

When the teams switched sides, UCSD 
rcturned to the site of game one and picked up 
the offense that it had left there. 

Although the Triton altack returned, the 
team continued to shoot it self in the foot with 
errors. 

As in the lirst game, UCSD held the game 
close, but could not bring home the win , drop-
ping the game and the match, 15- 12. 

Yarri s and Woods continued to lead the Tri -
ton oflcnse, picking up 14 and 16 kills respec-
ti vely. 

Thcre is no rest for the weary as the Tritons 
continue on their brutal MPSF road trip. On 
Friday they fa(;e UC Santa Barbara before 
'squaring off against Divi 'ion 1II opponent UC 
Santa Cruz on Saturday.

accompli shing. 

These athletes perform not for 
money, but for a medal which will 
forever symbo lize their dedication 
10 the sport. 

Lillie does this boy know of the 
changing tide of spons. He has no 
clue of the infi lt ration of green into 
the psyc he of all th ose assoc iated 
with sports. Nor does he under-
stand that the recent dec i ~ion to 
all ow NHL players to part ici pate in 
the Win le r Games in Nagano, 
Japan will permanently change the 
Winter Olympi cs.

that marked I he greatness of the 
Olympics i ' pass ing . Soon it will 
be taken over by the world of mar-
ke ting. do,ninated by Nike am] 
Reebok sponsored players flashing 
their insignias. 

The American public, once 
allured to the Olym pics by stories 
of athletes with normal lives per-
fo rming not-sa-normal feats, is 
soon to be replaced by the hype of 
the Dream Teams. 

In 1992, the world witnessed the 
supremacy of the U.S. Basketball 
Drcam Team. a collecti on of NBA 
superstars who, to put it mildly, did 
more than just tear new bodily 
holesin its wanna-be opponents 
tiny frames. 

Now, the world will see the 
Hockey Drea m Teams, supple-

For a child who does not ques-

Along with the majority 0 the

complain about how money has 
forever changed the path of the

Slowly the no-name heroes of 
yesterday will fadc from memory 
as wi lithe dream of one day reach-

There will, however, be a lot

Symbolic, hmm? There is a lot

UCSD Sports Clubs 
RUGBY 

Let the flood gates open and let 
the fury of the rains poor forth . The 
UCSD men's rugby team has offi-
cially begun its dominan<.:e with its 
tirst league match of the season 
against Cal State Fullerton (CSUF) 
last Saturday. 

In a 79-0 victory over the host 
CSUF Titans, UCSD employed a 
prolific scoring surge to make the 
game seem more like a waltz in the 
park than anything else. _ 

Looking to defend its Southern 
Collegiate Rugby crown from last 
year and hoping to keep the ball 
rolling on the heels of a 38-27 vic-
tory over No. 3 Stanford on Jan. 25, 
UCSD put out a solid defensive 
effort wlilch kept the Titans from 
scoring throughout the gaf!1e . 

In addition, UCSD spread the 
ball around well with 10 different 
players scoring tries and three play-
ers scoring 2 tries apiece. 

Leading the scoring for UCSD 
was Andy "Wilma" Wilga, who 
scored 19 points for the ruggers . 
Captain Troy "Helen" Meyer led 
his squad with strong efforts from 
Chay "Gangsta" Chang, Dave 
"Pee-Wee" Owens, Sevak "The 
Armenian Devil" Hayrapetian and 
rookie Don "Skeletor" Voogd. 

"We picked up where we left off 
last week with the Stanford victo-
ry," Coach Paul Reynolds said. 
"Again, the boys carne out ready to 
play, and it obviously showed." 

The ruggers of UCSD look to 
clobber another foe in Cal Tech 
University at Warren West field at I 

p.m. this Saturday.

SURFING 
There are many people dream of 

spending a weekend at the beach. 
Take for instance, the typical mid-
westerner who has never even seen 
the beach. 

The UCSD surf team couldn't 
even fathom the notion of not being 
at a beach, so it was no sUf1>rise that 
last weekend, the team was in the 
water, this time by the rainy shores 
of San Clemente. 

With only five of 20 surfers 
returning from last year, the team 
knew that this season would be a 
rebuilding one. 

This weekend, however, the 
inexperience didn't show as UCSD 
managed to make San Clemente its 
first competition with more than 
one surfer in the semifinals. 

In all, three surfers made the 
semis: Katy Clark took second 
place, Patrick Zabrocki placed 6th 
in the longboard competition and 
Ted Reckas also went to the semi-
finals. 

"The t.eam is steadily improv-
ing," captain Josh Rhodes sa id . 
"'This is a great year for us to 
rebuild ." 

The Tritons are <.:urrently sixth 
in their league with three cornpeti-
tions yet to come. 

- Bill Burler 

SADJNG 
"Damn you EI Nino!" This cry 

could be heard throughout Califor-
nia during the last week, especially 
last Saturday. 

The rainy conditions were 
intense that fateful evening, and 
there was concern that the Division 
III South I and 2 Collegiate Regat-
ta to be held on Mission Bay would 
be canceled. 

However, a minor miracle 
occurred and the heavens cleared 
just in time for Sunday's racing . . , 

Besides the gracious hosts, the 
field for the Regatta included teams 
from USC, UC Santa Barbara, UC 
Irvine, SDSU, Pepperdine and 
Stanford. 

The competition was dominated 
by USC, who won all but one of the 
races on the Regatta's final day, 
with UCSB and UCI rounded out 
the top three. 

UCSD ended up placing sixth, 
despite great individual perfor-
mances by Laura Hoover and Jay 
Johnson. 

"We didn't do as well as we 
would have liked," Coach Jim Leg-
eman said, "but the regatta was a 
learning .experience for all ."

Bicker said. "When there 's so 
much wind, you need to move 
your feet real well to set up your 
shots and I think the girls did that 
well today." 

Olsen affirmed her position as 
the team's No. I seed, cruising to 
a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Champion 
on court I. Tsai completed a sim-
ilar undressing at the No.3 slot, 
cruising to a 6-2, 6-1 win over 
Overstreet. 

"I remember Overstreet from 
last year because she hits the ball 
with such pace," Tsai said. "But

Faced with the possibility of a 
double-digit halftime deficit, 
Southern California's Amee Pina 
responded with three three-point-
ers, propelling the Vanguards to a 
39-36 halftime lead. 

The Tritons emerged from 
halftime trailing on the score-
board, but quickly stepped up the 
offensive execution. 

Summer Begley was simply 
unstoppable. scoring 9 of the Tri-
tons' first II second-half points. 
Much of Begley's success was

injury-free so far this year and I 
was playing real we ll today. The 
wind started to become a real nui -
sance in the middle of the third 
set and I though about changing 
my game, but I was playing so 
well that I decided not to change 
anything." 

Drimmer, the lone senior on 
the squad, came back from the 
disappointing doubles loss to 
handily thump Krista Austin at 
the No. 6 slot, 6-1, 6-2 and clinch 
the win for UCSD. 

Nguyen and Kondrack fin-
ished off the Crusaders with iden-
tical 7-5, 6-4 victories at the No. 2 
and 5 slots. respectively. 

UCSD will have two weeks

fornia College at North Courts on 
Feb. 18. 

trio of Jenessa Bayda, Kate Turn-
bull and Tristen Teasdale each 
found Begley with an excellent 
look. 

In the stat of the game, the 
women converted an unbelievable 
23 of 25 free throws down the 
stretch, consistently thwarting 
any Vanguard attempt at a come-
back. . 

Perhaps the only disappoint-
ment in an otherwise extremely , 
successful evening was the large 
number of blue seats which 
remained unattended throughout 
Tuesday night's contest. 

Listen Triton fans, these hoop-
sters are 16-3. Not only are they 
good - perhaps a whole lot bet-
ter than good - but they're but-

at 7 p.m. to RIMAC Arena.

the puck, tracking its motion as 
he approaches it. He doesn't 
noti(;e t.he station wagon that 
dangerously )'crec(;hes around 
the corner, nor docs he hear the 
shouts of warning by hi s 
onlooki ng fricnds . The driver of 
the (;ar reachcs for the radio sta-
tion dial, never noticing the boy 
streaking just ahead of the car. 
Suddenly .. . 

All of you who thought thi ~ 
nice, friendly little story was 
going to take a drastic turn for 
the worse with guts and brains 
being spilled all over the side-
walk, should all go see a psychi-
atrist. This isn't that kind of 
story, you twisted sickos. 

No, the boy wisely looks up 
at the last moment , just in time 
to escape the impact, and finds 
sarety with a headlong dive onto 
the sidewalk. 

After the initial shock, the 
boy again joins hi s friends, con-
tinuing hi s dreams of one day 
playing on the U.S. Olympic 
Hockey team. 

He is also a fan of the NHL, 
but it docs not hold the same 
mystique as the Olympic Vil-
lage and the ceremonies sur-
rounding the Games. It is truly 
something special, an event 
every four years featuring a 
gathering of great athletes com-
peting for the prestigious gold 
medal. 

Perhaps the fact that thi s 
gathering is only held once 
every four years allracts the 
boy's attention, making it more 
special, more esteemed. 

Perhaps it is the amazi ng sto-
ries of personal triumph sur-
rounding the athlete, including 
rehabilitation frolll seemi ngly 
career-ending inj ll rie~ . 

Or perhaps, if i~ the longing 
the boy sees in each athlete's 
eyes to be the best for no other 
reason than for the love of the 
sport , to excel beyond what they 
thought they were capable of

You're Money, Baby: The No.3 singles slot for UCSD was never in doubt as Kelli Tsai prepares to crush another forehand 
winner in her 6-2, 6-1 dismantling of Point Lorna's Cara Overstreet during yesterday 's 7-2 whipping of the Crusaders. 

SPARKLING: Everything from the new uniforms to .the new players was working for 
Head Coach Liz LaPlante's Tritons during yesterday'S season opener against Point Lorna 
By Sean Rahiml 
Senior Staff Writer 

1 know. IL was the brand-
spanking-new uniforms 
complete with blue-and-gold 
wind breakers for those 
cool, windy afternoons. 
Once the Crusaders 
realized that their infe-
rior sk irt-and-T .. shirt 
combination compared" 
to Janeane Garofalo at 
a Donna Karan show, 
the match was over. 

Maybe it was the 
dawn of a new season that 
instilled a great passion in the 
UCSD women 's tennis team -
lifting the Tritons to a convinc-
ing 7-2 victory over NAIA 
cross-town rival Point Lorna 
Nazarene College. 

The lone-gunman theorists 

would contend that the addition 
of freshmen Kir ten Olsen (Tor-
rey Pines High) has added depth 
and leadership to the squad . 

Nope, 1 still .think tt was the 
new gear. 

Whatever the case 
may be, it 's clear that 
1998 wi II be another 
successful year for Tri-
ton Head Coach Liz 
LaPlante and her 
squad. 

After a rebuilding 
1997 season which 

included four freshman in the 
starting lineup, LaPlante now 
fields a roster with just one 
freshman - Olsen is hardly 
considered a freshman consider-
ing Torrey Pines has one of the 
best tennis programs in Califor-
nia. Freshman Robyn Kondrack 

got her feet wet at the No.5 si n-
gles' slot and the No. 3 UCSD 
doubles team. 

" 1 was a lillie nervous at the 
beginning," Olsen said. "The 
wind was tough on the [service] 
toss, but you get used to it. [As 
for the season] 1 think we can 
have a successful year and get to 
the NCAA Nationals." 

LaPlante was very happy 
about her squad's performance. 

"( was really pleased with 
everyone 's performance," 
LaPlante said. "( don't think 
Point Lorna played up to their 
potential , but it was great to see 
our mental toughness. I think 
thi s year's team is benefiting 
from the experience the younger 
players received last year. 

Olsen teamed up with junior 
Maria Nguyen at the No. I dou-

bles slot, eventually earning a 
hard-earned 9-8 tie-break poi nt 
over Point Loma's Layne 
Champion and Theresa Kain . 

The Crusaders ball led right 
back in the No. 2 doubles slot, 
as the tandem of Cara Over-
street and Michelle Johnson 
narrowly defeated Jennifer 
Drimmer and Kelli Tsai, 8-6. 

UCSD, however, would hold 
on in the third doubles match. 
Sophomore Becky Jones and 
Kondrack teamed up for the 8-4 
decision - giving UCSD a 2-1 
advantage going into the singles 
portion. 

"It always helps to win the 
doubles portion of the day 
because it gives you momentum 
going into the singles section," 
Triton Assistant Coach Marc

Division III Proves To B.e No Challenge 
POOL DAZE: UCSD welcomed Division III rivals Occident'll, Claremont, Redlands and Pomona-
Pitzer to Canyonview Pool last weekend and promptly thrashed them despite a subpar day 
By Jacob Gordon 
Staff Writer 

Put five schools in a pool and you had beller 
watch out - anything can happen. At 
the Division ill Challenge at Canyon-

.. view pool last w~ekend, the Tritons 
were aiming to prove that they were the 
best team in the water. 

With Occidental College, Claremont 
College, University of Redlands and 
Pomona-Pitzer all in attendance, the 
Tritons were in for a challenge. The 
unorthodox format of the Challenge 
provide a good arena to see which 
actually the best. 

After·the preliminary heats, only one SWill1-
mer is selected from each team and they race in 
the final heat to see which chool comes out on 

top. 
Safe to say, the Tritons usually came 

out on top. In fact, the women wim-
mers carne in first in every si ngle race 
while the men won half of theirs. 

Rock-solid swimmers Shawna 
Caballero and Kelly Byrne each won 
two events while Jamie Rubino, 
Danielle Kidston , Keri Wilson and 
Linda Monroe all contributed win to 

the team effort. 
On the men 's side, Marc Latronica recorded 

a meet record in the 200-yard bUllerfly. Matt 
Payne, Jason Boettner and Tim McAteer all 
swam well as the Tritons placed a close second 
behind Claremont. 

The Challenge was also a good time for the 
Triton to brush up on something other than 
swimming - teamwork. 

"Individually, even if everyone is swimming 
fast," L!\inie Hilaiel said, "the best swims come 
from when the whole team is behind everyone 
and supporting everyone." 

With the Pacific Coast Swim Conference 
championship meet next week in Long Beach, 
the Triton hope to support all their swimmers 
and come home winners.
