Rally draws hundreds to protest cut 
Speakers denounce Reagan for 
plans to slice $3 billion in aid 

BY JOHN 'CHINNERER 
" Hig/zt'l Educatioll - Who Can 

Milord Ie " 

So read one of the signs at the A -
organized rally against the proposed 
cuts in financial ald . Th se cuts, 
proposed by the Reagan administra-
tion. would mean an approximate $3 
billion reductIOn in financial aid by t he 
1983-84 a ademic year. 

Before the start of the rally, which 
took place on Revelle Plaza at noon 
Thursday, igns denouncing the cut · 
were di tributed to students in the 

lowly growing crowd, which 
amounted to around 350 people at the 
height of the rally. Television crew ' 
and radio new people were on hand to 
record the event. 

The rally consi ted primarily of 
numerous speeche by concerned 
students. Tom Rutter, Financial Aid 
Dir ctor and the only repre entative 
from the admini tration, tarted the 
rally off wi th a rundown of t he basi 
facts and figurel> . The one that eemed 
to trike home the hardest wa the 
increa e in the category of "student', 
personal contribution." which Rutter 
stated would be in the neighborhood of 
$2,000-$2,500 by 1983-84. 

A pre -ident Jules Bagneris, who 
made some bri f introductory 
comment .., and acted as a "master of 
ce remoni s," announced Kristin 
. telck, a tudent Lobby assistant, as 
the next !->pcaker. Stelck announceed 
that t he en tire week had been declared 
" Resistance to Budget Cuts We k," 

and that rallIes against the cuts were 
taking place on all nine U cam puses. 
Then, ounding like a proponent of 
proposition 13, he stated 'Tm mad as 
hell," and proceeded to compare the 
student fight agall1st the budget cut s 
to the struggles of the oppres -ed in 
Poland. Chile, and EI alvador. After 

telck directed in ult at the Rf'agan 
administration, the previously 
subdued crowd became more voca\. "J 
think democratic revolution i still in 
the air (on college campuses and 
elsewhere,)" she stated at one point 
during her speech. 

Speaking next wa Student Regent 
Linda Sabo. In the middle of her 
address, a military plane flew 
overhead. Thi led to her concluding 
statement, which was to the effect that 
"San Diego is a military and 'defen e ' 
oriented area. We need to tell these 
people that bombs. mi ile ' , and other 
weapons are not where defen:e is. 
Education i. our best defense." 

People trickled 111 to fill out the 
crowd all through the fir 't . everal 
speaker. After aix) had finished. 
there was a brief "commercial break" 
to announce that tables were set up at 
the edge of the plaza \\ith petitions on 
the nuclear \veapons freeze, the water 
resource initiative. and the split-tax 
initiative. A table wa also set up to 
register voters and to collect let ters to 
be se nt to co ngress men and 
repres ntatlv s, protesting the cuts.

Scripps lifeguards 
In what was called a "purely budgetary cut," the 

University has decided to ave $17,000 a year by 
eliminating the lifeguard service at Scripps Beach, 

Is it really a "purely budgetary" cut? 

--

The UCSD Guardian Monday, March 8, 198~ 

Letter to the Editor Scripps Beach, due to hazardous tidal conditions 
and high popularity, accounts for over five times as 
many rescue as the rest of the La Jolla Strand. Last 
year alone, III water re cue were performed. 

That translates to about $153 per rescue, which 
hardly seems a budget·breaking expense, at least to 
us. 

RCC clarifies boycott position 
Editor: 

This year, according to past record, the attendance 
should rise to 350,000 or more, with a subsequent 
increase in water rescue situations. 

At the risk of belaboring the 
point, I would like toclarify , on 
behalf of RCC, our position 
concerning boycotts, AS 
policiC's, and society in general. 

UCSD students, faced WIth 
the prospects of cutbacks in 
financial aid and campu 
services, ris ing housing co t 
and a s tagnating campu

receptive to AS programs and 
effort directed toward their 
needs as students.

addressing issues wh ich 
directly pertain to UCSD 
students before attempting to 
become a political force on the 
national or international level. 
If the unfortunate trend of so-
called "student apathy" is 
ever to be reversed, the AS 
Council will have to 
concentrate its energy, time, 
and resources on project 
which are of genui ne, 
widespread student interest. 
We realize that the AS is 
currently engaged in several 
such projects and we urge the 
Council to continue in its 
st udent ·oriented endeavors. 
We are advocating not 
"isolationism" but rather, 
relevant, meaningful leader· 
ship. 

This year however, there will be no lifeguards. 
Director of Business Services Laura Long, who was 

directly responsible for allowing the contract to 
expire, reminds us that the guard service wa n't set 
up because "we (UCSD) felt any obligation to · the 
commu nity." No, it seems it was a greater problem. 
"The professors were complaining that people were 
using the gardens to go to the bathroom," Long says, 
laughing. 

With the guards gone, people will again come back 
and fertilize the gardens. But they will al'o come back 
and drown.

The Bottom Line 

A proposed Institute of Peace Research 
By DAVID KUPFER 

The purpose of the University of California IS 
con~tantly evolving. What its founders envisioned 
'ome 113 years ago was rather mode"l, an 
institution for their own time. 

The founders wanted a place where Californla\ 
youth could find as much lxlok wisdom as their 
mmds could hold and as much CII ility as they could 
learn from each ot her and from t he example" of t hei r 
teachers. They wanted a ~ource of pracl ical 
information about the crop. they planted. the 
animals they rai~ed, the mines they worked, and th 
roads and bridge that they const ructed. 

Fort u nat ely, all hough t he founders' viSIOn did not 
encompass the funct ions and potent iab recognized 
today, their wisdom in giving UC flexible 
foundations, organization. and government have 
allowed it to change and grow. Because the founders 
Imposed few restrictions, latter·day builders have 
been able to create one of the most renowned. 
influential, and complex In"t itut ions of higher 
learnmg ever del ised. 

There hould beconsen'>us bet\\een thenatHmsof 
the world today that homo -,apien" face a long li st of 
Interrelated planetary crise" of unprecedented 
magnllude: re'iource depletIOn. pol'erty, famine. and 
increasing populatIOn pre"ures; ecological 
destruction. materiali"m. and the spread of arms 
and violent revolution; and the increasing chance of 
nuclear warfare, which on its own could create 
unfathomable horrors. 

Clearly there exists an urgent need for a better 
understandmg of the complex Interrelationship, 
bet ween the~e global problems. Their solutIOns are 
dep nd nt on action based upon ~uch an 
understanding. 

The need for a (C Institute for Applied Peace 
Research has been pu blicly expre, sed by t hose at t h 
\ery highest levels of l O\verslly admtnistration: in 
February 19 I, by Regent Willi!', Harman in proposal 

for a Center for Cooperative Global Development; in 
~1ay 1981, by University President David Saxon in 
an address to the National Conference on 
International e(urity and Arms Control at 
Lawrence Livermore Nat ional Laboratory; and in 
June 1981. by Gm'ernor Edmund G. Brown in a 
proposal for a enter for Global Security and 
Cooperation. 

The University has been far from acountable In 
the area of promoting peace, for the UC Regents act 
a!-. managers of a nearly $1 billion Department of 
Energy contract to operate t he Lawrence Livermore, 
B rkeley. and Lmi Alamos nuclear research labs. 
More than one·fourth of the labs' work is directed 
toward research and design of nearly alJ kinds of 
nuclear weapons built by t he US gOl'ernment. 

The University of California needs desperately to 
take on a catalyst ro le in the effort to trans late the 
world's current spiral toward nuclear war into a 
global movement for peace and equitable resource 
management. Conce rned student s have been 
working actively to make this idea a reality for a long 
while. 

On ovember 12, four out of five voting students 
at UC Davis endorsed in concept the Peace Inst it ute. 
Furl her. they Indicat ed strong support for an 
obj ctive, comprehen~ive Institu te, developed with 
broad stud nt parti ipation, and located on a HC 
Campus with extensions on each of the remaining 
UC Campuses. They agreed that such an Ins tilu te 
shou ld engage in tran sd isciplinar y, problem-
oriented research. as Wf'1l as public dialog. on 
cooperation, d velopmen\, and non·violent. non· 
military means for atta ining global s urity. 

Albert Einstein once said that if you don ' t chang 
where you're headed. you're likely to get there. The 
quest ion i!-., where do we. t he inheritor ' of a trou bled 
world, want to end up. I must agree with what 
Richard Nixon said in 1978 at Oxford. that "i t tS a 
real s hame if today's young people don't g t involvl'd 

in something bigger than themselves ." 
The UC Academic Council recently appointed a 

' pecial Committee on Globa l Security and 
Cooperation to consider the establishment of a 
center to explore new and existing ways to control 
1 he development, use and proliferat ion of nuclear 
weapons, as well as the waysin which thepre!-.sures 
of Third World development impinge on pot ntial 
international conflict. 

The Committee. made up of members of the 
systemwide Academic Senate, has begun its 
deliberations and has invited r sponses from alJ 
interested members of the academic commu nity. 
They're also soliciting information about ongoing 
research activities that address these issues. Fifteen 
copies of statements of interest and ongoing 
research shou ld be su bmilted to: Special Committee. 
Box G, Office of the Vice· President , University Hall. 
Berkeley, CA 94720. These statements must be 
received no lat er than December 15 if they are to be 
considered by the committee in formulating its 
recommendations. Proposals that have already been 
received by the ommillee may be reviewed in the 
Academic Senate Office on very campus. The 
, tudent Body Presidents ouncil has become active 
on thi~ issue and in order to see at ransdisciplinary. 
non· ooptable institute created. is submilling a 
proposal of their own. Cont act your local SBPC R p 
through Student Government. .. 

Peace is a universal issue l!\'eryonc shou ld be able 
to relat to. As the world popular'e trudges down a 
helter·skelter path, mor propl, from religious 
leaders to President ' s daughters to houswives to 
University Presidents, are jumping on th peac· 
mongering bandwagon . My point IS1here's room for 
more.

Lifeguards eliminated at Scripps Beach 

Contract expires after 16 years 
BY SCOTT YOUNG 

Slaff Wriler 
Last year university-funded 

li feguards at Scri pp~ Beach 
had responsi bility for 333.000 
people. ancl made an all -time 
record II I water re~cue". Thi" 
year. in what Laura Long. 
Director of Bus iness Sen Ices 
calls a "purely budgetary 
cut back" in t he wake· of 
"contInual funding con-
Sllall1ts." the lifeguards' 
... t'f\'icl's haw' been com])1 ,t ely 
elimlllated. 

On No,. 1. 19HI. the 
contract UCSD had \\Ith tht' 
city of San Diego for lifeguard 
serv ices was allowed to exp ire. 
aft er s Ixteen vear, . 

Begun in 1964, the contract 
prOVIded fo r lt feguards, 
equipment and a whicle from 
Mal' l to l"\ovember I of each 
year. 

The sen' ices in 19 I ·o .... t the

Long. w ho is officiall y 
responsibl e for letting the 
contract expire. discussed in 
a n interviel',: how the lifeguard 
sef\' ice began. " It was more for 
the conveni ence of Scnpps_ .. 
t he water safet\' was

complaining thilt I){,"ople were 
going to the bathroonl in the 
gardens." S haktng her head 
and laughing, Long referred to 
the initiation of th ..,en' ices, 
"No. it wasn't done bec:JLlse \\(' 
had an obligation to the 
communitv." 

Though Long wasn't aware 
of It. the University own" the 
beach as a res u ll of a 
California legis lat i\'e gra nt in 
1929. Because of this, gt. 
O'Hare fee l" "it's the Regents' 
responsibi lI ty to pr'ltect the

Lobsters: succulent sea d\Velling "bugs" 
BY BERT N. KOBAYASHI 

"Hey. Bert! Let's go bu~ing tonight 
to the Sweet Secret Spot! ' That was 
the greeting that my good diver 
friends. Wayne Cottle and Mike Sweet, 
thru t upon me as I walked into my 
office last Thursday morning. As all of 
us seafood fanciers know, the 
California Spiny Lobster is called a 
"bug" and diving for lobsters is called 
bugging. Sweet's Secret Spot can not 
be precisely defined by this writer for 
fear of getting my air turned off during 
a dive by my good friends. shou ld I 
announce that this secret supermarket 
for lobsters is located in North County. 
The avid interest in the California 
Spiny Lobster stems from the 
succulent and hearty taste of the tail 
meat - broiled lobster tails. sprinkled 
liberally with butter and paprika. with 
a dressing of rice and mushrooms. 
topped with cheese is a di h that any 
budding Galloping Gourmet would be 
proud to serve! 

Well. just what is a California piny 
Lobster? Technicall y. it is a dl'capodon 
arthropod. or. as the name sign ifies. an 
animal with 10 jointed legs. All of the 
8500 specie of decapod are simi lar in 
design, being generally called shrimps. 
crabs. or lob ters. The more than 20 
species of piny lob ter' belong to the 
family Palil/uridae. In North America. 
there are three species: our Californian 
species, Panulirus inlerruptus. ranging 
from Point Conception (around the 
San Luis Obispo area) outhward to 
Bahia de Magdalena (a lmost to the tip 
of Baja California on t he Pacific Coa t); 
the Mexican langousta. Pal1ulirus 
iI/flatus. ranging a far north as San 
Diego. and southward throughout the 
Gulf of California - it has an 
attractive blue·green colorat ion wit h 
white spots, longer appendages. and 
many more pine (don't try to catch 
one of these without gloves!) than the 
California lobster; and the Florida 
Spiny Lobster. Paflulirlls argus. which 

range~ throughout t he Caribbean . and 
up the eastern coast of Florida. This 
eastern lobster is s imilar in 
appearance to the Mexican species, 

The newcomer to bug hunting will 
rapidly find out that certain areas ar 
better than others for finding lobsters. 
Certainly. the sandy bottom is not 
really a " hut ~pot:" the nx-ky bottom 
needs holes of sufficient size and 
configuration to con tain lob!' ters 
measuring more than 11 inches long, A 
rocky area with lots of sea urchins is 
no! conducive to lobster abundance. 
even if the holes and forage are ideal. 
However, prime abalone areas are 
often good bug sites, Lobsters may be 
found at all diving depths. including 
shallow tidepools. Films made by 
DEEP STARdepict lobsters as deep as 
635 feet in Scripps Canyon! 

There are certain areas where 
lobsters are more easily caught during 
the day - these are spots where the 
ledges or dens are not interwoven. and 
only extend back a foot or o. Other 

areas in which the dens are densely 
interwoven or the ledges are deep, 
become more productive at night, 
when the nocturnally feeding lobsters 
are out foraging. Hence. the Sweet 
Secret Spot is a sure payoff on 
virtually any non· moonlit night with 
small surf. 

The legal catch size of a California 
Spiny Lobster is a minimum of three 
and one quarter inche , measured in a 
straight line from the rear edge of the 
eye socket to the rear edge of the 
carapace. or body shell. This actually 
represents a lobster of about 1 o If! 
inches long. or one lightly less than a 
pound in weight, Thi s s ii:e 
determination of three and one quarter 
inches is one that cannot be fudged : 
you must carry some measuring device 
that will permit the accurate gauging 
of the lobster's size. The daily take 
and/ or po s i sion limit of even 
lobsters is Ii beral; even Wayne can't 
eat seven lobsters at one sitt ing! Most 
divers find it impo ible to "limit out." 
and a catch of three to four bugs is 
con idered terrific, 

During the day . lobst ers are found in 
holes . wi th on ly their antennae 
projecting beyond the margin of the 
hole, A the int ruder approaches. 
especially an area in which other 
intruders have alreadv traversed. the 
lob s ter ba c ks in-t o the hole 
immediately, If not. one has a much 
better chance to capt ure it. The pros . 
such as Mike and Wayne. place one 
hand on the outside of each antenna as 
clo 'e a. possible without alarming the 
lobster. Then. with a swift and sudden 
motion, their hand dart in and grab 
the base of each antenna. The outer. 
long segment of the antenna is ea ily 
broken off, for the lobster backs away 
and spins at t he same instant that 
contact i e. tabli hed, This is why 
many first ·time lobster divers have 
been stranded with a bunch of lobster 
'"chop. tIck .. and nothing to eat. Thp 
larger the lob 'ter. the easier it is to 
catch. but the harder it i to pullout of 
its hole, A IO·pounder will be quite 
"'trong. and it may be a few minutt'. 
before one is able to wrestle it out of its 
den . Once out of the hol e. one hand can 
be used to grasp the lobster firmly at 
t he bases of bot h antennae. open up the 
lobster bag. and place the lobster mto 
the bag with Ihe back of the lobster 
int roduced into the bag first and the 
legs afterward. In this manner. one 
wi ll avoid the frustrat ingexperience of 
having the lobster grab the bag and 
close it for you before it is completely 
secure in the bag, 

Lobsters are nocturnal scavengers. 
meaning that they leave their dens and 
hunt for food at night. Shortly after 
dusk. many of the bugs start charging 
about in the surf gra s. up and down 
the sides of rocky reefs. up on the palm 
kelp, or even walk about on the and. 
Many divers find this time to be most 
productive in finding and catching 
lobsters. The trong beam of an

underwater flashlight transfixes the 
bug for a few momen ts, especially if 
the diver is the first one into the area . 
As the lobster turns to meet the diver. 
it is seen to be carrying its antennae 
over its back. inasmuch as it uses those 
antennae for warding off a 
predatory fish . 

Because of my many years of 
experience with lobsters, I am asked 
several que tions repeatedly, which r 
will now pose and attempt to answer 
for the reader, 

How old is a lobster? Although 
estimates of age vary widely. it is 
generally believed that a barely legal 
lobster is about 7·8 years old , Once 
hatched from the egg, the lobster goe 
through at least 12 dIfferent larval 
stages while swimming around in the 
water column. Thev are small and 
transparent during -the 6·9 months 
spent in the e stages. The la t 1·2 
stages are spent on the bottom. among 
the surf gra '!' in very shallow waters. 
before transformation into a juvenile 
lobster. The lob ters are greenish in 
color then (an effective camouflage 
mechanism when among surf grass). 
Within the first year. these sub-adults 
mou It (or cast off t heir external shells) 
up to 20 times, each time adding on a 
little s i7e, During the second year of 
life, the moulting frequency decrease ... 
to 10·12. 3·4 times during the thIrd 
year. and 1·2 times annually by the 

fifth year of life. Thus. a legally-sized 
lobster only moults once yearly; the 
much larger ones moult only once 
every other year or even les 
frequentl y. A 10-pound lobster has 
been estImated to be anywhere from 
20-50 years old. 

What happens to a lobster when a 
diver breaks off a leg or antenna and 
fails to capture it? Given that the 
lobster is not fatall y incapacitated by 
the loss of such structures. it can 
regrow the lost leg or antenna, 
However. it takes a minimum 'of 3·4 
moults to replace a leg or antenna 
fully. 

How does a lobster reproduce? The 5 
paIrs of walking leg are all SImilar to 
each other in the male lobster; In the 
female. t he last pair of legs has an 
ext ra claw on t he term III a I ~egment. 
This claw is probably used to assIst III 
the t ran ' fere nce of egg from the 
0\ ipositor (egg·deposlting opening) at 
the ba e of the third pair of walking 
legs to the swimmerets on the oottom 
part of the tall. lhe "'perm·depositing 
opening is located at the baseofthe5th 
pair of leg!-;, The tall has se\'en 
abdomlllal section". each with a palrof 
swimmerets on the \ entral ,Ide. In the

Speaker on plasma physics 
BY KEVIN FINE 

Dr. Marshall Rosenbluth of 
the University of Texas at 
Austin gave the Maria Mayer 
physics colloquim last 
Wednesday, speaking on some 
of the problems with 
containing plasmas for 
nuclear fusion. 

Rosenbluth ha worked on 
the problem of nuclear fusion 
for many years, and is 
probably the best known and 
most often cited plasma 
physicist alive today . His 
audience f;lIed USB 2622, and 
included phy icists from 
nearby universities and local 
companies. 

Under conditions of 
extremely high temperature 
and pressure, matter becomes 
a gaseous mixtureof positively 
and negatively charged 
particles called a plasma. 
Nuclear fusion is the process 
in which light atomic nuclei 
combine under these condi-
tions to form heavier nuclei . 
This fu sion reaction releases 
energy. An example is the 
tran formation of hydrogen 
into helium that occurs in the 
Sun, and which ultimately 
produces the energy we use on 
Eart h. Nuclear fi ssion, on the 
other hand , w hich is presently 
u. ed in reactor, is the proces ' 
in which atomic nuclei are 
~plit by co ll ision: with 
energet ic par ticle . 

Fu sion has already been 
artificia lly produced in the 
hydrogen bom b. However, no 
one has been able to control 
fus ion to generate elect rical 
power. If controlled fusion 

were achieved. fu ' ion 
advocates believe that man 
would have it virtually 
inexhaust ible supply of clean 
energy. 

There are a number of 
approaches to controlling 
fusion that are being 
invest igated today. Rosen-
bluth spoke about the 
approach that many feel is the 
most promising. This 
approach uses a machine 
cal led the tokamak. 

Rosenbluth explained that 
the heart of the tokamak is a 
donut -shaped vacuum cham-
ber, 'everal feet across in size. 
The vacuum chamber is 
surrounded by magnets that 
produce a magnetic field that 
follows the inside of the donut. 
circling around the donut hole. 
Hydrogen gas is introduced 
into the chamber and then 
heated until the gas becomes a 
plasma. The particles in the 
plasma foll ow the paths of the 
magnetic field lines. The field 
is shaped so t hat none of the 
particles touch the wall of the 
\'acuum chamber. where they 
would lose energy. 

As t he par t icles circle 
around the int erior of the 
vacuum chamber, they are 
heated us ing various met hod . 
If t hey become hot enough. 
then coll isions between the 
part ides wIll produce fusion 
react ions, wh ich wi ll qeate 
energy. To create more energy 
than is consumed by I he 
tokamak. the hot plasma must 
be conta ined for a long enough 
penod of time. T he poi nt at 

which as much energy is 
creat ed as is consumed is 
known as 'breake\'en .' 

No one has yet been able to 
contain the plasma long 
enough to achieve breakeven. 
The reason is because of many 
different kinds of inst abilities 
in t he plasma. These 
ins! abilities allow t he plasma 
to leak out of the magnetic 
field to the vacuum chamber 
wall, like water leaks out of a 
cupped hand. 

The inst abilit ies come about 
because the plasma produces 
its own magnetic field, which 
distorts the magnetic field of 
the tokamak. Dr. Rosenbluth 
divided the in!.tabilit ies into 
two classes, the large scale or 
macroscopic instabilities and 
the small scale. 

At t he end of t he talk, 
Rosenbluth was asked why 
fu sion research has progres-
sed so slowly, not ing that 
decades have pas:ed wit hout 
success, and furt her inquired 
wheth er Rosenbluth reall y 
believed thaI fu sion would 
ever produce power for our 
homes. 

Rosenbluth said that he 
definit ely thought that one day 
we would make an experimen· 
t al tokamak that wou ld 
ac h ieve breakeven. He 
thought , however. that a 
commercial power plant was 
considerablv more difficult . He 
said that there i:-. no guarantee 
t hat a commerciall y \'iabl 
fusion tokamak wi ll ever be 
built .

Earthquake research 
BY JOE FALLETTA 

Senior Siall Writer 
Eart hquake : the earth 

trembles , the ground beneath 
the feet heaves and groans 
while all one can do is stand 
helplessly vulnerable in a 
rfoorway and hope this will not 
be t he big one. 

For Californians, this fear is 
perhaps more common than in 
other parts of the continental 
Unied States, because of the 
much-publicized San Andreas 
Fault which begins near San 
Francisco. and runs south into 
the Gulf of California. Neither 
t he phenomenon nor t he fear is 
limited solely to California. 
though. 

Prediction of earthquakes 
with an eye toward lessening 
their more serious eHects. is 
the task undertaken by a 
group of researchers at 
Scripps Institute of Oceano-
graphy. As part of a larger 
program up and down 
California which studies a 
number of predictors and 
better met hods of traffic 
management and hazard 
reduction , Scripp scientists 
Dr. Harmon Craig, Dr. Yu-
Chia Chung and Sergi o 
Damasceno monitor the levels 
of gases like radon and helium 
in deep well and spring water 
along three fault Jines, in an 
effort to find a I ink bet ween 
increases in gas levels and l he 
likelihood of an eart hquake. 

Craig explain!. the theo ry, 
ca lled the dilatancy theory, 
sayi ng that rocks deep within 
the earth's crust cont ract 
along one plane and expand 
along another un der pres ' ure, 

caus ing their pores to open. 
Ga ses Irapped within the 
rock s are then relea sed 
through the hot underground 
water. and eventually find 
their way to the surfa e or to 
monitoring tations at points 
along the faults. 

Radon and Helium 4. 
familiar to us as the gas that 
fills the blimps and dirigibles, 
flows from within the eart h's 
crust. However, Helium 3 
originat es deep within the 
earth's mantle and has been 
monitored off the tip of Baja 
California, up the Gulf of 
California and as far north 
inland to the Salton Sea. 
Traces have al so been 
di scovered in Africa where 
Craig notes the horn of that 
continent is said to be breaking 
off similarly to the manner in 
which California 's San 
Andreas Fault is splitting the 
slate. 

Helium 3, discovered by 
Scripp ' re earchers 10 year 
ago, wa fou nd in t he large 
plume. of black moke seen off 
the tip of Baja California late 
last year , and is released in the 
geyse r at Ye ll ows t o ne 
Nation al Park. Craig -ays. 

And while r esea r c hers 
continu e to moni tor the 
release of t he gas at t hese 
poin ts. Craig and Chung note 
t he~ have not been able to 
come up Wilh any time-table 
regard ing ei t her the San 
Andreas Faul t or the horn of 
Africa.

UCSD swimmers earn a 2800 mile trip 
Overall, this is the best 

swim team in UCSD history. 
But as swimming coach Bill 
Morgan tells it, "This has been 
the most difficult season I 
have had as a coach at UCSD. 
We have had a lot of illne ses 
and injuries, but we have just 
about re cove r ed from 
everything. " 

diving points. Those points 
would hav e mad e the 
difference between victory and 
defeat in two dual meet this 
season, which would have 
improved the team's record 
from 2-5 to 4·3. 

Nor did Coach Morgan map 

out an easy schedule, choo ing 
to swim again t an Diego 
Stat e twice and the University 
of Nevada at Las Vegas, both 
Divison I schools. The 
women 's team suffered from 
much the same problem as the 
men , having only one diver, 
even though Maur een 

Kavanaugh is the best woman 
diver in UCSD history. Coach 
Morgan is already hard at 
work to relieve this dIving 
problem. Morgan IS lUring 
swimmers and divers to UCSD 
with the promise of a new 50 
meter pool complete With one-
and three· meter diving boards. 

BY THOMAS SCHMIDT 
On the north wall of the 

swimming pool complex hung 
a banner proudly proclaiming, 
"Virginia or Bust! Qualify and 
you fly for free! " And in case 
there was any dou bt, there 
was a banner on the east wall, 
which read, "Yes Virginia, 
there are National Qualifiers 
from UCSD ." These two 
banner summed up the scene 
at the UCSD natatorium last 
Friday and Saturday evening. 

Ten UCSD men qualified in 
17 events for the National 
C h a mpion s hip s at the 
University of Virginia, while9 
UCSD women qualified in 27 
event s for the Wom en's 
National Championships to be 
held at the University of 
Ma ss achusetts. And yes 
Virginia, they are all fl yi ng 
free! 

One thing the team never

divers. No, not a lack of good 
divers, but a lack of any divers 
at all. At the beginning of the 
season, the team had a diver in 
the person of Derrick Douglas, 
but when the UCSD Diving 
Coach quit over Christmas 
vacation to take the pos ition of

The women's tennis team 
defeated Westmont College 
Friday, and annihilated Cal 
Lutheran Saturday. Friday's 
7·2 victory featured singles 
triumphs by Vikki Lareau , 
Laura Saavedra, Jenny Rens, 
and Lucille Fernandez. All 
three doubles teams won. 

Saturday's match against 
tiny Cal Lutheran wa ' as 
lopsided as could be. I n fact , in 
sweepi ng the six singles 
matches the most games any 
Cal player won in a set was 
two. Neither Saavedra nor 
Fernandez 10 t a single game . 

The s ingles action Friday 
was highlighted by a grueling 
two hour, 33 et struggle 
between Lareau and Skye 
Haskell. Top seeded Lareau 
took charge early to win the 
fir t set 6·0, but Haskell 
battled back to take the second 
6·3. Laureau 's concentration 
and stamina gave her the edge 
111 the third set, for a 6·1 tally 
and the victory. Impre 'sive 
newcomer Lucill F rnandez 
u 'ed a strong serve and timely 
volley to defeat Allison Snelly 
6-0,6-1. 

[n doubles competition 
Friday, good teamwork by 
Cath y Sturdivant and 
Fernandez granted them a 2· 
set victory over Dana 
Woolbright and Lisa Ahler .

playing back , and Fernandez 
charging the net, they 
returned almost everything 
while constantly putting thei r 
opponent on the defensive. 
Strong consi tent serving by 
both girls added to their 
success. 

Nadine Akimoto and Rens 
played extremely well 
together. Rens' quick feet 

helped her outrun deep lo~ 
and rush the net. The 
nonchalant Ren al -0 used a 
powerful serve 10 attacking 
her opponent . Aklmoto 
returned orne very difficult 
shot including volley . at her 
feet, which she somehow 
scooped over the net.

Canadian's rugby 
against UCSD 

BY TYNA CALLAHAN 

lO r don't have anything good to say," A istant Coach Peter 
Sertic grumbled as the UCSD Rugby team left the field after a 19· 
3 loss la t Thursday. 

Penaltie weakened the Tritons in their game aga1O<;t 
Peter boro, Canada, and sloppv play eventually lost the game 
"We gave it away, basically," said ertic. 

The team '~ few good plays, though hea\'ily overshadowed b~ 
the bad, were exceptional. Dan Walters cored IIC D' only 3 
points on a kick for POSt at an extremely difficult angle, 
Beau tifu l teamwork and wonderful plays came 111 spurt , but the 
Tritons . imply lacked the con. istency to overpower the touring 
Canadian team. 

As the sea. on progresses, quite a fe\\' players are being 
sidelined with injuries . Thi non-league game was not played 
with the normal limit of only two substitutions per match . The 
free su bstitution policy gave t he coach a much needed chance to 
experiment with players and to evaluate the team's depth . 

What the team gained from these experiments could prove 
very valuable next aturday ,March 13. at the College Playoffs in 
Long Beach.

The Recreation Department has thi~ message for all UCSD 

studet:Jts and staff: All gym IclCkers must be cleared or renewed 
by Fnday, March 19, 1982. To clear, lock and towel must be

Bill Lewi . ,of the PE Department emphasi7es t hat, "By t h time

AT &T gives us Electronic Yellow Pages 
BY JUNE TAYLOR 

Pacific News Scrvi('c 
What book is found in 

almost ever y home and office 
in America? What advertising 
serv ice is used by virtually 
every business in the country, 
generating revenue of almost 
$3 billion, with profit · 
reported as high as 50 to 60 
percent? You guessed it - the 
Yellow Pages. 

What happens to all those 
Yellow Pages revenues and 
profits when AT&T and its 22 
Bell operating companies are 
split up? lJ you know the 
answer to that question, 
please notify the US Congress, 
the public utility commissions 
of the 48 states, the American 
News paper Publi s hers of 
America and a host of 
consu mer groups and Bell 
competitors. They'd all like to 
know. 

Under the historic AT&T 
ant itrust agreement reached 
last mont h, the local Bell 
operating companies are to be 
separated from the parent Ma 
Bell , which retains long· 
distance line s, Wester n 
Elect ric (eq u ipment), Bell Labs 
(research) and - the Yellow 
Pages. In exchange, the new 
AT&T can enter computer 
and information bu s iness 
from which it previously was 
barred . 

It is for t his new computer 
and lectronic information 
arena that AT&T wants to 

keep the computerized Yellow 
Pages information. Given the 
anticipated boom in telephone· 
link ed home . computer 
systems, AT&T cou ld 
transform the Yellow Pages 
into perhaps the largest mass 
clectronic advcrtising scrvice 
in the nation . 

Yellow Pages also contain 
"one of the largest data bases 
on t he face of the eart h," 'ays 
John ultenberg, legislative 
director for the North 
American Telephone Associa· 
tion, a trade group represent· 
ing Bell competitors. That 
data ba e, according to 
G ullen berg, "gives AT&T an 
enormous dimension in the 
area of in formation and data 
research." 

The Yellow Pages debates 
taking place here fo us on two 
very different but important 
issues: What does the loss of 
Yellow Page revenue mean to 
local phone rates? And what 
does the entry of AT&T into 
electronic information mean to 
AT&T competitors, which 
soon cou ld include news· 
papers? 

There is widespr ad 
concern about local telephone 
rate hik s to make up for the 
local operators' loss of the 
I ucrat ive long·distance service 
and Yellow Pages. Florida 
Public Service Commission 
Chairman Joseph Kress told 

ongress t oat th' loss of 
Yellow Pages revenues would 

mean a $33 million annual 
increase in Florida phone bills. 
In New Jersey the estimate is 
$52 million; in California it's 
$43 million. 

However, Assistant Attor· 
ney General William Baxter, 
who fashioned the AT&T 
set! lement, said he sees no 
reason for operating compa· 
nies to lose out. He and others 
argue that the most important 
part of the Yellow Pages - the 
Subscriber Li ,t - will remain 
with t he local operating 
companies, which can sell it to 
the highe t bidder or to many 
competi ng directory outlets. 

Few doubt that AT&T, with 
its vast capital resources, will 
win if it comes to bidding for 
the right to control Yellow 
Pages. A AT&T moves into 
electronic adverti ing, new 
Yellow Pages services are 
po sible, The Yellow Pages 
cou ld updated daily , for 
in tance, instead of annually, 
making it possible to advert ise 
special events and salcs . 
Traditiona lly, I his sort of daily 
advert ising has been the 
backbonc of daily newspapers, 
which are worried about 
c l ctronic cnmp tition from 

T&T . 
Electronic Yellow Pages also 

would p rmit nat ional rat her 
th an just local listings. This 
would represent just the tipof 
an iceberg of future 
inform at ion scrll ices that 
could be brought into 

American homes bycombining 
telephones, televisions and 
computers. Shopping by 
televi ion, an electronic Sears 
catalogue and hookups with 
libraries all are in the offing. 

But the rub is whether 
AT&T would be allo\\'ed to 
provide stich a sen'ice over It" 
long·distance lines, Although 
AT& T faces growing competl· 
tion from companies \\' tlh 
satellites and micro\\'a\'e rela\ 
systems, AT&T still controi"s 
more than 95 percent of long· 
distance telecommunicat ions 
and has the onl\' access to 
many markets. the virtual 
monopoly over t he electronic 
distribution system was the 
original reaso-n for keeeping 
AT &T out of information 
services. 

AT&T argues that a 
separate subsidiary \\,tli 
handle the information 
systems and says its Long 
Distance Division will treat 
that subsidiary the same as 
any competing business that 
wants to pay to transmtl 
information. ome doubt such 
an arrangement would be fair 
to com pet itors. 

"Their ( T(' T'~) track 
record on keeping one bu 'ine ' 
separate from another has not 
been t hat great," says a 
legislative staffer working on 
new t elecommunicat ions 
legislation that sh( uld clear up 
the gray areas I ft b th 
breakup. 

The new legislation will not 
allow AT&T to sell informa· 
tion by long di, tance over ib 
own line.'. It could, howe\ er, 
pay :\1C1 or anot her ~atellite 
firm to transmit data. 
"Without t hi" separat Ion 
there I" a IXltentlal for pricing 
abuse," the !'\taffer noted, 

AT ·T is e\.peeted to fight 
thl" legIslation But to molltf~' 
critics concerned over the l o~..; 
of Yellow Pages reyenue ... 10 
local companIes. AT& r 
Chairman harle<; Brown ha~ 
sugge ·ted the tran~lllon to 
AT&T control be pha<;ed IJ1 
over fou r vear<;. 

This soluti on docs not 
please consumer advocate~ 
"What's gOll1g to happen after 
foun ear ?" asks Paul tern of 
the ' National CItizens 
committee for Broadca~tll1g, a 
Ralph Nader organization 
"Sooner or later someone I~ 
going to have to pay t he pIper, 
and It's going to be the rate· 
payer. This is big bucks,", 
note~ tern The Nader group 
thll1ks legislation is needed to 
protect consumer interests . 

The question of AT(',T'. 
entry into long distance 
i nformat ion rests WIt h 

ongress. But the i. stleof ho\\ 
local revenues will be affected 
ultimately rest:'; with the 
operating companie. and th 
state commISSIon' that 
regulate them , WIIh so many 

II1terest~ at . take, it's certain 
to be a good fIght
