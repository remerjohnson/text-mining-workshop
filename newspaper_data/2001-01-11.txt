CUE and University Reach Agreement 
Historic first contract took two and a half years of negotiations 
By VINCENT GRAGNANI 
Senior Staff Writer 

University clerical workers. following a rati-
fication vote by members of the Coalition of 
University Employees. have a new contract 
with the university that provides for wage 
increases through 2001. including retroactive 
payments. 

"We are very pleased to have reached this 
agreement with CUE: said Judith W Boyette, 
UC associate vice president for human 
resources and benefits. "I want to thank clerical 
employees for their patience and for their con-
tinued dedication to the university during the 
negotiations process." 

The contract. signed by UC and CUE repre-

sentatives on Dec. 20, 2000. took two-and-a-
half years to negotiate. 

"This is a historic first for CUE: said CUE 
President Claudia Horning. a library worker at 
UCLA. "This is the first contract for CUE. and 
we've made many significant improvements 
over the previous union's contract. CUE mem-
bers should be very proud." 

The contract includes a 7.8 percent cost of 
living increase over two years, and maintains a 
"step-merit" system of salary increases. 

The contract includes new procedures that 
require a bona fide business purpose to con-

North Torrey 
Pines Parking 
Structure Opens 
New option for commuters 
to create room for everyone 
By MAn SCHRADER 
Associate News Editor 

An additional 380 "S" parking spaces 
became avai lable Saturday when the new 
North Torrey Pines parking structure in 
Thurgood Marshall College opened. 

The structure. which has been in con-
struction since August 1999. also contains 
309 "B" Spots. 161 ··A" spots. 104 metered 
visi tor spots and 18 handicapped spots. 

The • orth Torrey Pines Lot. located 
between Scholars Drive North and :'\orth 
Torrey Pines Road . has six floors and two 
entrances. A new entrance onto campus on 

orth Torrey Pines ROild is set to open 
March 1. which will provide more conve-
nient access to the structure. 

Students believe that the ability to park 
everywhere on campus will be made much 
easier due to this opening. 

"Hopefully it will alleviate the parking 
problems in Muir." Muir sophomore Adam 
Roston sa id. "Parking there has become vir-
tually impossible past 8 a.m." 

Th~ fall opening of the Gilman parking 
structure provided an additional 307 "S" 
parking spaces as well. However. the six-
level structure fills to capacity early in the 
morning and is full-until late in the after-
noon when most students have already gone 
home . 

"Based upon our fall quarter 2000 sur-
vey. the'S' spaces ·in this structure tilled to 
peak capacity about 9 a.m .... Director of 
Parking and Transportation Greg Snee said . 
"The 'B' spaces. 197. filled to peak capacity 
at about 11 a.m .. and 'N spaces. 147. reach 
their maximum usage at 2 p.m." 

Students who arrive past 10 a. m .• though 
they cannot park in the two new structures. 
said they still reap the benefits of them 
being there. 

"It just makes parking easier other 
places on campus: Marshall sophomore 
Eric Robin said . "East parking is a lot less 
crowded now that people are parking closer 
to campus. The lazy students are getting a 
break. too."

Scripps Scientist Mia Tegner Dies in Diving Accident 
She was a UCSD alumni, an accomplished scuba diver and a faculty member since 1969 
By GEOFF DIETRICH 
Contributing News Writer 

Longtime Scripps researcher 
Mia Tegner died Sunday in a 
scuba diving accident off the coast 
of Mission Beach. She was 53 
years old. An accomplished diver 
and scientist, she spent her adult 
life associated with UCSD. 

· We knew Mia when she was a 
young adult just beginning her 
scientific endeavors: said 
Charles Kennel. director of the 
Scripps I nstitution of 
Oceanography. ·She grew to 
maturity with us, and s~nt her 

life at Scripps." 
Tegner. a native of Southern 

California. graduated from UCSD 
with a bachelor's degree in biology 
in 1969. Five years later. she earned 
a doctorate in marine biology from 
Scripps. She based her research 
from Scripps ever si nce. 

Wayne Pawelek. head diving 
safety instructor at Scripps. had 
the pleasure of knowing, working 
and socializing with Tegner since 
she arrived at Scripps in 1969. 

"She lost her life doing what 
she truly enjoyed: Pawelek. said. 

Tegner's research dealt with the 
ecology of kelp forest communi-

ties and near-shore marine 
resources. She spent nearly three 
decades studying and protecting 
the Point Lorna kelp beds. 

Tegner's work has helped 
other scien tists better understand 
the kelp forests. and has also 
helped government officials to 
better understand the effects of 
urban runoff and sewage on 
marine life. 

Her work greatly contributed to 
the decision by the California 
Department of Fish and Game to 
implement a moratorium on the 
taking of abalone from offshore 
Southern California. 

"She dedicated more than 25 
years of work to the ecology of the 
kelp beds off Point Loma in San 
Diego. and she developed a new 
and deep appreciation for this del-
icate. undersea rain forest." Kennel 
said. 

At the time of her passing. 
Tegner was researching the effects 
of EI Nino and La I ina on the 
plants and animals of the kelp 
ecosystem.

Collegiate: 
Suit filed after position 
awarded to a black man 
Ca I .d ........ l 
punitive damages in a suit filed in 
April 1999. ' 

Pfohl filed suit after Paul Rice, 
then dean of the university'S com-
munity collese, acted against a 
search commIttee's recommenda-
tion in August 1998 and awarded a 
full-time teaching position to 
Quentin Hollis, a black man. 

Under the settlement, Pfohl was 
appointed to a trnure-track posi-
tion of aSlistant professor in the 
psychology department. She will 
earn $30,528 a year and will enter 
her founh year of the tenure tradt 
this fall. She has worked at Western bom full-time and put-time sina 
1980. 

Pfohl claimed that Rice told her 
that Hollis was given the job 
because Rice got pressure &om 
Huda Mdky, had of the Equal 
Opportunity/ADA compliance 
office. Hollis hid one year of tach-
ing experience at Owensboro 
Commlp1i~ College and was flay-
ing professional basketbal In 
China at the time he was hired. 

- Melky said she had nothing to 
do with - Rice's decision to go 
against the search committee's n;c-
ommendation_ 

In the deposition, Melley did 
admit that the reason for Hollis's 
hiring was, in pan, because 17 per-
cent of the students at the commu-
nity college were minoriti~ and 
there were no blaCk faculty mem-
bers. Melky said she looked at 
Holl is and Pfohl as equal candi-
dateS.

CINCINNATI - A new sleep 
study suggests pulling all-nighters 
may impair the ~rain 's ability to 
learn new material. 

The results of the study, which 
appear in the December issue of 
the medical journal "Nature 
Neuroscience," suggest a good 
night's sleep helps the brain store 
information learned during that 
day. . 

The study further suggests peo-
ple who interrupt a sleep pattern by 
staying up all night risk their abili-
ty to master certain tasks, said 
Robert Stickgold, a researcher at 
Boston 's Harvard Medical School. 

The study tested 24 Harvard 
students' ability to learn new tasks. 

Partkipants took a test to iden-
tify certain images that were 
flashed briefly on the lower left side 
of a video screen. 

The control group slept regu-
larly each night of the four-day 
study, while the experimental 
group was deprived of sleep on the 
first night. 

At the conclusion of the study, 
researchers found those ,who slept 
all four nights retained their 
knowledge and learned more while · 
those who stayed up just one night 
failed to improve their perfor-
mance. 

When people skip one night of 
sleep, even if they catch up later, 
they may find infonnation has not 
been stored properly in the cortex, 
which is responsible for storing 
infonnation.

Although many like the fact 
that there is new parking on cam-
pus, some have begun to question 
the new North Torrey Pines struc-
ture. 

"[The new structure) is in the 
middle of nowhere," Revelle junior 
Yang Fan said_ "It seems like it is 
only for Marshall students. There 
should have been more student 
input" 

Fan said the types of parking 
spaces are disproportionaf to the 
number of people who actually 
need than.

spaces filled to 86 percent occu-
pancy at 1:00 p.m." 

In order to combat this prob-
lem, Transportation and Parking 
Services and Nelson/Nygard 
Consulting Associates are working 
together to produce a new trans-
portation and parking study to 
determine the magnitude of the 

~=Iem and where to go from 
"The UCSD parking and 

transportation study should be 
completed in the winter quarter 
2001," Snee said. "The UCSD 
Transportation Policy Committee 
will be reviewing these recom-
mendations at the end of winter 
quarter 2001." 

Warren junior Rick james said 
the only way this study wiU be 
beneficial is if they finally begin to 
see that parking for students is 
both vital and necessary . 

"I just hope they don't take the 
easy way out and say that aU this 
campus needs is more arpooling 
and vanpooling; he said 111It is 
aU wdl and good. but it reaDy 
doesn't fill the students' needs. 
nq. need to realize that a lot of . 
the problems just won't go away 
and that students just need extra 
spots to park in." 

A similar study was done in 
1996 to make parking projections 

and recommendations for the 
2005-2006 school year. 

Among the ideas discussed in 
this document was the possibility 
of building a new parking struc-
ture in or near University Center. 
The study projected it could be 
constructed by the 2005-2006 fis-
cal year. 

Most students agree this was a 
good idea, although they wish it 
were built five years ago. 

MUniess I take four senior years 
this really won't have any effect on 
me; Robin said. MBut at least my 
brother will get a chance to park 
close to Price Center. W 

Many considerations, includ-
ing the size, location and its level 
above or below ~ound are still 
immediate conSIderations that 
have to be decided before any 
new structure is built. The study 
said the new structu~ if built, 
should contain around 750 park-
ing spots. 

Of similar imponance, the 
committee made the proximity of 
the structure to all major build-
ings on campus a large priority. 
According to the study, the new 
structure should be built no 
more than half a mile from all 
major buildings on. campus such 
as Geisel Library, the Price 
Center and the International

Center, as the extra walk would 
not allow for quick access to 
these sites. 

Additionally, the decision as to 
whether the structure will be 
above or below ground has yet to 
be made. If above ground, the 
structure will have to comply 
with height and design require-
ments. If the parking were to be 
below-ground, an additional 
building will have to be con-
structed above the subterranean 
parking levels. 

The above-ground portion of . 
the structure could possibly 
become a new expanded book-
store or career services center, 
among other possibilities. 

According to the study done in 
1996, the committee was consid-
e~ng at least 11 other possiple 
Sites. ~ 

Among the sites in contition 
are a 875-spot, five-story co plex 
along Myers Drive that ould 
cost around $9,500,000, a,' 765-
spot, five-story complex ftSt of 
Russel Lane that would cost 
around $7,300,000, and a 960-
spot, four-story underground 
parking structure and four story 
above ground medical building 
west of the school of medicine 
that would cost about

Ashcroft Takes 
Conservatism to 
the Extreme 

The conservative former Missouri Sen. 
John Ashcroft recently received widespread 
criticism upon his nomination as attorney 
general. The Guardian feels this criticism is 
warranted and that Ashcroft's extremely con-
servative congressional record makes him an 
unfit choice for an office of such significance, 
and that a more moderate politician would 
be better qualified for this position. 

A vocal opponent of affirmative action 
programs, Ashcroft voted to end funding for 
struggling minority- and women-owned 
businesses. He also opposes all abortions, 
induding those sought by victims of rape 
and incest. Ashcroft also voted against an 
increase in the minimum wage in 1999. 

The former senator's approach to envi-
ronmental and foreign policy is equally 
conservative: He opposed a bill that 
decrellsed government funding of logging 
road-building in national forests and he 
voted to decrease funding for researching 
solar and renewable energy. 

In addition, in 1997 Ashcroft voted 
against a bill that would favor China firms 
that had adopted a code of conduct on 
human rights. On gun control, he supports 
the right to carry a concealed weapon and, 
in 1999, he voted against mandatory back-
ground checks at gun shows. 

Ashcroft also has supported legislation 
that infringes on the Constitutional guaran-
tees of freedom of speech and privacy. He 
supported the Communications Decency 
Act, which would have censored and fil-
tered Internet content regardless of users' 
preferences. Also, he voted for mandatory 
honorable discharge of all HIY-positive mil-
itary service members. 

The Guardian feels that this politician is 
clearly the most partisan-voting, right-wing 
party loyal that President-elect George W. 
Bush could have chosen for the weighty 
office of Attorney General. 

We feel overall that the attorney general's 
office should be held by a less extreme par-
tisan. Though many argue that the opinions 
held by the Attorney General would not 
affect his or her ability to execute the laws, 
such views would carry great weight within 
the Justice Department itself. 

Such internal attitudes guide policy 
development and steer the course of legisla-
tion that the Department collaborates on 
with the Congress. Digression with regard 
to policy and action has undeniable conse-
quences in the Justice Department's inter-
action with the executive and Congress. 

An ideal Attorney General must guide 
policy options with such offices in the inter-
ests of bipartisanship, not extremism. 
Ashcroft does not fit this description and 
would certainly develop Department policy 
in the adverse interests of most Americans.

Fractured Down the Middle: 
The U.S. Senate Splits in Two 

The fifty-fifty dMde in the Senate shows how moderate our nation has become 
, and the importance of working collectively to achieve national progress 

SenIor Sf", Writer 

When voters went to the polls on 
Nov. 7, 2000 to decide the future leader-
ship of this country; they expected the 
outcome of the dection to be very close. 
Nobody could have imagined how close 
the results were. 

In the end, America witnessed some-
thins that had never 0CCWTCd. Yes, the 
presidential protests and contests went on 
for 35 long, arduous days. and. George W. 
Bush was finally declared the WInner of the 
270 dectoral votes necessary to become 
the 43rd president of this great land. 

The historical importance of the dec-
tion does not, however, lie in the election 
of the chief executive, but in the U.S. 
Senate. For the first time in this nation's 
history, the Senate will have a split of 50 
Democratic senators and 50 Republican 
senators. 

On election d~y, voters from across 
the country sent to the Senate freshman 
Democratic senators hailing from 
Delaware, New York, Florida, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Washington, Missouri and 
New Jersey, and two freshman Republi-
can senators from Virginia and Nevada. 

The freshman senatorial class of 2000 
includes Jon Corzine of New Jersey, a 
former Goldman Sachs chief executive 
who spent $60 million of his own money 
to win a position in government that 
pays a paltry $141,300 a year. There is 

Jean Carnahan, who will be replacing the 
first-ever deceased person dected to the 
Senate, her husband Missouri Gov. Mel 
Carnahan. Not to be outdone, there is of 
course HiUary Clinton, who is the first 
first lady to be dectcd to the Senate. A 
final Mfirst" of notable mention is that 
there will be 13 women serving as sena-
tors in the 107th Congress. To be sure, 
2001 can be titled "The Year of the 
Woman in the Senate." 

All in all, Republicans who used to 
enjoy a 54-to-46, four-vote m~in over 
their Democratic counterparts have now

Shadrock 
Theory 

SHANNON CASTLE 
Well everybody, happy New 

Year. Seniors, it's officially time to 
start worrying about what you're 
going to do after spring finals. 

While I've been thinking about 
the ominous future for several 
years now, it has suddenly dawned 

• on me that, come June, I will no 
lon~er be a student. Even if I 
dectde to apply myself to graduate 
education to postpone my career 
path, I have to do something dur-
ing the down time. This realiza-
tion provoked a few minor panic 
attacks during my otherwise rest-
ful winter break: 

What am I going to do with my 
life? How am I goi)lg to get into 
medical school? Do I really want 
to be a doctor? Do I want to 
pend the rest of my life pipetting 

microliters of solution? Should I 
run off to Guatemala and work 
with street children instead? 

I'm sure the rest of my fourth-
and fifth-year brethren share 
most, if not all, of the above senti-
ments. Even if you're not serious-
ly considering the plight of Latin 
America's chi ldren, you're proba-

bly trying to figure out what you 
are supposed to be doing with 
your life, and how you're actually 
going to make that happen. If you 
already have that all figured out, 
please stop reading. 

The hard truth is that no mat-
ter what we decide now, the odds 
are pretty good that we'll make 
some drastic deviations from 
those plans in the future. You 've 
already seen this in college: Half of 

The hard truth is that 
no matter what we 
decide now, the odds are

make some drastic 
deviations from those 
plans in the future. 
the pre-meds decide to go into 
psychology, and a good portion of 
Revelle jumps to another college 
to avoid the humanities sequence. 

After school, or between 
schools, people are also allowed to 
jump areas of interest. Don't 
worry so much about what you're 
going to do in June; chances are, it 
won't be permanent. 

While I hate to drag my family 

into my school's newspaper, my 
father is a perfect, almost laugh-
able, example of what I'm talking 
about. After getting a degree in 
business, he went to law school, 
graduated, and then decided not 
to take the bar examination. Thus, 
he never practiced law. 

He then went into the com-
mercial real estate business for a 
while. Mer getting bored with 
that, he built a boat and became a 
commercial swordfisherman for 
several years. Since then, he has 
revisited real estate, left real estate 
and formed a pay phone company. 
The pay phone market is crashing 
due to cell phone usage, so he has 
something else up his sleeve ... 
I'm clueless. 

My dad is a crazy example of a 
career switcher, and he enjoys 
being self-employed more than I 
ever will, but it's an interesting 
case nonetheless. If he can go 
from law school to fishing in a 
span of two years, then I can 
change my mind about what I'm 
doing, too. 

My point here is that even 
though we'll all graduate from 
UCSD with a great education, we 
don't necessarily have to use the 
knowledge from our degree. We 
can be flexible. I have one friend 
who is graduating with a degree

OPINION 5 

Living in the SbadOw of 
Parents' Success 
Writer struggles to overcome her feelings 
of inadequacy and confusion about goals 

Staff Writer 

Like many UCSD students, I 
suffer from overly successful par-
ent syndrome. In a sense, some 
would think I have the perfect 
life. My parents, though divorced, 
have taken care of me nicely. 
They have provided me with love, 
shelter, food and even dealt with 
my conspicuous consumption 
phase during high school and 
junior high . And even though 
their marriage didn't last, my col-
lege fund did. I am going to col-
lege on Mommy and Daddy's 
money. 

Yet somehow the spark of life 
isn't within me - the spark that 
most young adults my age seem 
to have, to go out and get that 
first paycheck, to settle down, 
have a family. My parents outdid 
their parents economically. It 
depresses me that I will have to be 
way more successful to even 
come close to their proportionate 
economic success. Economists 
have been saying for years now 
that the Pepsi Generation will be 
the first one to earn less than its 
parents. 

The work ethic my parents 
have is extremely intimidating. 
My mom graduated from UC 
Davis in three years. She has 

been working since age 14 and 
has been working full-time for 
the state since the age of 20. She 
has steadily moved up the ladder 
in various personnel depart-
ments of state agencies, and at 
49 is looking to retire in a few 
years. 

My dad did relatively the 
same. He said he started work-
ing when he was eight, no joke. 
He is now 62 and getting ready 
to retire after more than 35 years 
of being an engineer for the 
state. And I haven't even men-
tioned my stepmom or stepdad 
yet. 

I cannot fully explain the type 
of cloud that seems to surround 
me every time I begin to think 
about my future. At times, I will 
be in a state of euphoria , totally 
at ease with life and my academ-
ic progress. And then I think, 
I'm a piece of crap. I haven't 
worked for anything all my life. 
L've had three summer jobs, all 
paying near minimum wage. My 
parents have been supporting 
themselves si nce before th ey 
were out of high school. They 
paid for all of their schooling in 
college. No matter what I do, 
how can I compare to Mom or 
Dad?

that the Senate will act upon very 
early during its session . l'he first

with newly eltcted Democratic 
senators, will pass a partial-birth 
abortion ban. 

This ban has a good deal of 
support from Republicans and 
Democrats alike, including Cali-

American people with the signa-

Following a tax cut, there are 
many issues that the Senate can 
and will deal with. There is the 
reform of the public education 
system, campaign finance reform, 
the strengthening of America's 
military, and the restructuring of 
Social Security. These important 
issue have strong bipartisan sup-
port from our elected officials and 
the voters who have put them in 
their positions.

just hope I don't end up chasing

_erican Airlines and Uniteel to Pay 
$500 Million for TWA Assets 

The fate of the audacious plan

lators, several labor unions and a 
Delaware bankruptcy judge.

selves securely at the top, towering

result of the United-US Airways 
merger. 

Both Donald). Carty, AMR's 
chief executive, and James E. 
Goodwin, the chief executive of 
the UAL Corp., United's parent, 
praised the deals as positive devel-
opments for shareholders, the 

traveling public and workers at all 
the airlines involved. 

"From an employee, operating 
and financial standpoint, these 
three deals - both individually 
and taken together - make 
tremendous sense." Carty said. 

But opponents, including con-
sumer groups, travel agents and 
politicians, continued to voice 
their concern that the deals would 
lead to higher fares and dimin-
ished service. Both the House of 
Representatives and the Senate 
are planning hearings on the 
transactions. . 

Carty said that the issue of air-
line competition is moot in the 
case of TWA because the carrier is 
on its last legs. 

"It's hard for me to see a gov-
ernment not approving the TWA 
transaction; he explained, "unless 
something comes along that we 
don't yet anticipate, some other 
opportunity, some other way of 
sustaining or maintaining TWA:

For Texas, California Provided Example 
of How Not to Deregulate Energy 

HOUSTON - Nearly three 
years ago, Texas lawmakers and 
regulators preparing for electricity 
deregulation visited California to 
study its first-in-the-nation exper-
iment. 

For two Texas legislators, 
Steven Wolens, a Democrat, and 
David Sibley, a Republican, it was 
a memorable trip. "I remember 
saying to Sibley, ' If this is what 
deregulation is, we don't want it:" 
said Wolens, a state representative 
from Dallas. 

Neither, it appears, does 
California anymore. On Monday 
night, Gov. Gray Davis deemed 
the state's experiment a "colossal 
and dangerous failure" and pro-
posed government intervention to 
meet the state's energy demands, 
stabilize rising prices and help 
ensure that the twQ largest private 
utilities avoid bankruptcy. Then 
Tuesday, Davis was in Washington 
for a White House meeting with 
federal officials to discuss 
California's energy crisis. 

Yet even as deregulation is 
collapsing in tht; nation's largest 
state, the second-most-populous 
state, Texas, is moving forward 
with its own plan, one intended, 
in part, to avoid California's 
problems. In March, Texas will 

begin a marketing campaign, fol-
lowed in June by a pilot program 
involving 5 percent of the state's 
customers, then culminating 
with full deregulation in January 
2002. 

The Texas law, signed in 1999 

Yet even as deregulation 
is collapsing in the 
nation's largest state, the 
second-most-populous 
state, Texas, is moving 
forward with its own 
plan, one intended, in 
part, to avoid 
California's problems. 

by Gov. George W. Bush, remains 
untested, but the crisis in 
California has not yet prompted 
any official second-guessing. The 
Texas Legislature convened 
Tuesday, and Sibley predicted that 
the law would remain intact. The 
prevailing view among many offi-
cials, and one shared by some 
energy analysts, is that. California 

simply had a bad plan. 
The fundamental difference 

between Texas and California 
boils down to simple supply. Karl 
Stahlkopf, a vice president at the 
Electric Power Research 
Institute, a nonprofit research 
organization funded by the utili-
ty industry and based in 
California, said California had a 
surplus of electricity until recent 
years. But as demand gradually 
outstripped supply, California 
did not respond by building new 
power plants. Partly because of 
tough environmental regula-
tions, Stahlkopf said, California 
has not built a major plant in 
more than a decade. A new plant 
is scheduled to begin operating 
in June. 

Texas, by contrast, has a power 
surplus. Since 1995, the state has 
built 22 new plants, with 15 more 
scheduled to be operational by 
2002. Texas is also unique among 
the contiguous 48 states in having 
an independent power distribu-
tion grid, and thus falls outside 
federal regulation. Texas officials 
also said it takes far less time to 
build a plant in Texas than in 
California.

would amount to an expensive 
revolution that most farmers 
would resist. 

Schroeder appeared to recog-

a wholesale move to biologically 
friendly farming could not provide 
"enough healthy food at affordable 
prices." but Kuenast, the co-leader 
of the Greens, said she was deter-
mined to steer agriculture "back to 
nature. " 

The outbreak of mad cow dis-
ease has heightened already strong 
concerns among European con-
sumers about how "natural" or 
"organic" their food is. 

This mood has set the conti-
nent on a collision course with the 
United States over genetically 
modified corn and other food-
stuffs, and this conflict seems like-
ly to intensify. "Europeans do not

French Judges Pry Open Forbidden Doors, Right and Left 
PARIS - France's former chief 

justice is about to go on trial in a 
convoluted scandal involving the 
oil company Elf and a mistress who 
once gave him a $7,000 pair of 
handmade shoes. A former 
Socialist finance milltster is 
accused of backdating documents 
to hide a large kickback. And even 
President Jac9ues Chirac has had 
to go on televtsion recently to deny 
accusations that he was at the cen-
ter of a COil lIption scheme when he 
was mayor ct Paris. 

After dec.:des in wh;ch allega-
tions of corruption among public 
r fticials were rarely pursued with 

much vigor, a new generation of 
French prosecutors is boldly open-
ing dozens of inquiries and press-
ing hard for the evidence they 
want. 

Lately, so many cases have been 
opened and public officials impli-
cated on all sides of the political 
spectrum, that one prominent 
Socialist, Bertrand Delanoe, 
summed up the situation by saying 
that if all those accused were con-
victed, " it would be an empty 
field."

After decades in which 
allegations of corruption 
public officials were 
rarely pursued with much 
vigor, a new generation of 
French prosecutors is 
badly opening dozens of 
inqunes. 
istrates have taken to searching 
ministers' homes and carting even 
the most elite - including theson 

of the late President Francois 
Mitterrand - off to jail for a little 
questioning. 

Some hope that France is on the 
cusp of something big: a thorough 
housecleaning of a privileged polit-
ical class seemingly at home with 
kickbacks, having their apartments 
remodeled by state workers and 
gaining ghost jobs for family and 
friends. Others, however, point out 
that there is still a long way to go 
from aggressive investigations to 
convictions. 

"Today the judges are doing 
their work,n said Claude Angeli , a 
managing editor of the satirical 

weekly Le Canard Enchaine, which 
is noted for its investigative jour-
nalism. 

"Today they have a sense of 
morality:' Angeli said. "They are 
more civic-minded and they have a 
hunter's instinct. Some of them 
want to be media stars, too; it all 
mixes in together. They see the 
sums of money that are being 
talked about, and they see thei r 
salaries and they are reacting. They 
are on a mission:

Review: ~~~~M 

Blur 
"Blur: The Best Or: 

EMI Records 

A 
After six albums and more than a hand-

ful of hit songs, Blur has finally released 
"Blur: The Best Of: The album provides 18 
tracks of Blur and their growth from their 
1991 release, "Leisure," through their most 
recent release in 1999, "13." 

For those of you whose knowledge of 
Blur doesn't go beyond the techno-casino 
sounds of "Girls & Boys" and the familiar 
"Whoo-Hooo!" of "Song 2," then this 
album will open your eyes to the musi<; that 
is distinctively Brit-pop. 

Blur was first known as Seymour and 
started out playing their style of art-punk in 
various places around London in the late 
'80s. In 1989 they changed their name to 
Blur, signed to Food Records and released 
"Leisure," which included hits like "She's So 
High" and "There's No Other Way: 

"Modern Life is Rubbish" was released in 

1993 and it pioneered the Brit-pop sound of 
the early- to mid-1990s. The lush My 
Bloody Valentine-esque guitar work with 
Beatles-esque harmonies and the use of 
string and brass sections achieved a witty 
collection of songs. 

Their first No.1 album, "Parklife," con-
tinued Blur's collection of hit songs includ-
ing "Girls & Boys" and gave them four Brit 
Awards. 

With the release of their next album, 
"The Great Escape," Blur became part of a 
media-created rivalry with Oasis. "The Great 
Escape" reached No. 1 in the British charts 
and sold 1 million copies in Britain. 

Their self-titled album, "Blur" was 
released early in 1997 and they were instant-
ly known stateside with their two-minute hit 
simply titled, "Song 2'-

"Song 2" also found its way into com-
mercials, movies and other promos. Largely 
ignored were songs like "M.O.R." and 
"Beetlebum: 

Their most recent studio album, "13," 
was lyrically direct and emotional with 
beautiful musical textures. Blur songwriter 
Damon Albarn wrote about his painful 
break-up with Elastica's Justine Frischmann 
and used the brilliance of William Orbit to 
produce the album. 

Their "best of" album collects all of the 
songs that define Blur and their career. Clas-
sics such as "Parklife" and "Charmless Man" 
are included with the light melodies of 
"Country House" and "To the End." The 
bonus disc includes 10 songs from their 
concert at Wembley Arena. 

"Blur: The Best Of" is a fantastic way to 
open your eyes to more than just the Amer-
ican radio hits and it's a great way to start 
the foundation of your Blur collection.

The Presidents want 
your vote this year 
After four years The Presidents return 
with a newfound focus on the music 
Staff Writer 

Just when you thought you were stuck 
with this president for the next four years, 
you might want to look at the three candi-
dates you should've voted for but punched 
the wrong chad. 

All three members of the band formerly 
known as The Presidents of the United 
States of America - Dave Dederer 
(bass/guitar/vocals), Chris Ballew 
(guitarlbass/vocals) and Jason Finn (drums) 
- are now back together, simply going by 
The Presidents. 

They might not have the answers to all 
your burning political questions, but they 
definitely have their post-election party 
planned, bringing you what could have been 
the most promising platform of the election: 
music that makes you laugh. 

The Presidents have always been 
remembered for their clever song-writing 
and tunes you ,could never get out of your 
head. The Grammy-nominated Presidents 
previously released two full-length records 
on Columbia. 

Their most recent release, "Freaked Out 
and Small," hit stores nationwide in Sep-
tember. This latest project has a number of 
new twists but still maintains the band's 
original sensibility. 

For this album, The Presidents didn't 
rehearse the songs. They went into the 
studio, learned the songs, and then record-
ed them right on the spot, taking only 
three months to wrap up the entire 
recording process. The pure musical talent 

and energy created by this unique envi-
ronment is evident on the 12-track compi-
lation. 

"We just have some kind of magic when 
we play together," Dederer stated. "I can't 
describe it, can't define it, and I don't 
think any of us can take credit for it . It's 
just plain dumb luck to find that kind of 
synchronicity, and it shouldn't be trifled 
with." 

"Freaked Out and Small" is The Presi-
dents' first full release since 1996. The 
new album is a strange mix of what you 
would expect to hear from The Presidents 
plus something similar to the sound of 
punky pop rock bands like "The Mr. T 
Experience: The Presidents' . first single, 
"Tiny Explosions," is heavily guitar driven 
and more rock than comedy. 

The lyrics are not quite as ridiculous as 
previous releases but they definitely make 
up for it with their new focus on the music. 
Five strings and half of a drum kit are all 
The Presidents ever needed to make their 
insanely catchy pop ditties. 

But don't think they've lost their funny 
bone, because tracks such as "Jazz Guy" and 
"Jupiter" still make you laugh and remind 
you why this band is so great. The new 
album really shows some growth for the 
band. 

You can tell they wanted to come back 
strong, sounding a little different but still 
keeping the comedy act. Their music is fun, 
they have more ability with half of the 
equipment, and they remind us that those 
other presidents take themselves way too 
seriously. .

Outlook: "Head Over Heels" is 
another teen-pop flick that proves 
that all you need to make a movie 
is a pretty face. This movie lacks 
the credibility and plot to be 

_ much more than another chance

actor. Not only is the plot ridicu-
lous, but it also has the intelli-
gence of the movie's character, 
which is none.

Feb. 9 
Starring: Anthony Hopkins, 

Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta, 
Frankie R. Faison, Giancarlo Gian-
nini, Francesca Neri and Zcljko 
Ivanek. 

The sequel of "The Silence of 
the Lambs" has the escaped Dr. 
Hanniba l Lecter (Hopkins) being 
the hunted instead of the hunter 
when an old victim of Lecter, 
Mason Verger, tries to seek 
revenge and attempts to kill 
Lccter. In order to do this, Verger 
uses FBI Agent Clarice Starling 
(Moore) as a tool to capture 
Lecter. 

Outlook: The original movie 
proved such a success that 
Thomas Harris wrote another 
chilling book in order for a movie 
to be made. Although money was 
the catalyst, this film will prove to 
be one of the more thrilling and 
haunting films of the year. With 
director Ridley Scott and Anthony 
Hopkins back as the lead, this film 
will brinr, a realistic, spine-chilling 
thriller t!lat is macabre and grue-

Liam Aiken . 

Keanu Reeves plays a busy 
execu tive too concerned with 
himself to care for the well-being 

of others. His way of life changes 
when he meets an awkward but 
free-spirited woman (Theron) 
who persuades him to spend a 
month with her in order to 
change not only his views, but 
also his way of life. However, nei-
ther of them expected to fall for 
each other. 

Outlook: This weak premise 
portrays itself as a warm, sentimen-
tal romance. A love story demands 
chemistry between the two leads, 
but Reeves and Theron are not 
known for their great acting. The 
odds of seeing not only good acting 
but also great chemistry from the 
two actors are the same as having a 
legitimate and fair election in Flori-
da. 

The Mexican 
March 2 
Starring: Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts 

and James Gandolfini. 
Jerry Wei bach (Pitt) is in a tight 

situation because he has to not 
only recover an antique pistol for 
his mob boss, but also has to deal 
with the fact that his girlfriend 
Samantha (Roberts) wants him to 
end his association with the mob. 
Trouble ensues when Jerry recovers 
the pistol, which turns out to be 
cursed, and by the fact.that Saman-
tha is now held hostage by a hit 
man. 

Outlook: Brad Pitt and Julia 
Roberts, with their immense star-
power, will ensure that this film will 
be seen by many and will be a suc-
cess at the box office. This pre-
dictable film looks to be decently 
funny with a good blend of not 
on ly comedy, but also romance, 
drama and action. 

Animal Husbandry 
March 30 
Starring.: Ashley Judd, Greg Kin-

near, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei 
and Ellen Barkin. 

In this romantic comedy, Ashley 
Judd plays talk show producer Jane 
Goodale who is in a romantic rela-
tionship with Ray (Kinnear). When 
their relationship turns south, Jane 
uses her knowledge of the male 
animal to write a sex column. In 
the proct:ss, Jane and her column 
become a sensation. 

Outlook: This look into men-
women relationships falls flat as 
the script seems shallow and it 
clarifiE.'s the obvious. As a result, a 
meaningful understanding is 
never developed. Judd has been in 
many bad movies lately and this 
seems to be just another one of 
them.

lead, overtaking the Roadrunners 
by 18 points, making the score 54-

as though the Thtons were on their 
way to a win, building a 39-31 half-
time lead. UCSD used the perime-
ter shooting of guard Maya Fok, 
who hit four three-pointers. 
However, CSU Stani.slaus came out 
strong in the second half, outscor-
ing UCSD 42-22 for the half. With 
the loss the Thtons fell to 7-4 over-
all, and 3-3 in CCM.

The next two games, both away,

ranked in the top 25, Dillon said 
that the Tritons "will try their best" 
to win on the road. 

Accolades Abound 
for 'Triton Athletes 
Both men's and women's soccer and men's 
water polo honored at season's end 
Iy ROBERT FULTON 
Sports Editor 

The excellence of UCSD's fall 
athletes was affirmed recently when 
they received a number of honors 
and awards. 

'TWo members of the Division II 
National Championship women's 
soccer team, Cindy Dostalek and 
Julia Cuder, were named to the 
2000 National Soccer Coaches' 
A.ssociation of America AII-
America First Team for Division II. 

Dostalek had a fantastic season, 
scoring 12 goals and dishing nine 
assists. To top off her stellar season, 
she scored the winning goal in the 
Division II championship game. 

Cuder, a junior, finished the 
season with eight goals and 13 
assists. Four assists came in a game 
against United States International ' 
University, which tied a school 
record. 

Erika Alfredson joined Dostalek 
and Cuder on the 2000 National 
Soccer Coaches' Association of 
America All-West Region First 
Team for Division II. Alfredson, a 
junior,led the Thtons with 16 goals 
and eight assists. 

In the pool, the men's water 
polo team was no slouch as far as 
awards are concerned. 

Jonathan Samuels, who was 
instrumental to the Trito.ns' berth 
in the water polo championship 
game, was named to the Second 
Team All-American by the 
American Water Polo Coaches 
Association and was named 
Division II Player of the Year. 

Samuels, a junior, dominated in 
the pool. He scored 67 goals, and 
logged 29 steals, 17 assists and nine 
blocks. 

Triton head coach Denny 
Harper was named Division I 
Coach of the Year. Harper coached 
the Tritons to a 21 -9 record this 
year and a berth in the champi-
onship game. He was also named 
Division II Coach of the Year. 

Jason Boettner and Justin Wylie, 
both seniors, earned Division I AlI-
American honorable mentions and 
were named to the Division " AII-
American First Team. Senior goalie 
Glenn Busch also made the AII-
American First Team. 

Not to be left out, the men's 
soccer team also garnered its fair 
share of awards. Sebby Saadati, 
who was unstoppable for the 
Tritons, earned First Team All 
American Division II honors. 

Saadati, a junior, logged 10 
goals and four assists in guiding 
the Tritons to a 11-5-2 record.

unbelievable to me. I never 
thought I'd be a part of three 
national championships." 

She attributes her success 
largely to her teammates, with 
whom she closely identifies, and 
especially to McManus. 

"I don't think I would have 
gotten anywhere if it wasn't for 
Brian," Dostalek commented . 
"He's more than just a coach, he's 
a friend too. He's always there." 

Now Dostalek is faced with the 
difficult task of coming to tenns 
with the end of her career. 

"I think the hardest obstacle is 
• finding a way to give it all up now 
and finding a way to move on," 
she said. "[Soccer] became a part 
of my life. Everything I do and the 
people I've met are associated with 
the sport: 

Dostalek, who is ending her

for it. We need to serve well and 
side out at a high level to be suc-
cessful. Most important, though, is 
making sure that we continue to 
play with a high degree of compet-
itive excellence and stay consis-
tent." 

The Thtons embark on their 
2000-2001 campaign this Friday in 
smog-choked Riverside, where they 
will battle with California Baptist 

·University. Larsen sees this as an 
advantageous way to open the sea-
son . 

"This weekend will show us 
where we are at this point and 
what we have accomplished so 
far," he said. "Cal Baptist has a 
good program, with scholarship 
players, but we should be able to 
do well against them. More impor-
tant will be to keep up our level of 
competitiveness in the next few 
matches." 

Those next few matches will be 
the team's initial Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation games, where the 
Tritons will face off against their in-
league nemeses. First up amongst 
them is their Saturday night 
matchup with UC Santa Barbara, 
in the team's home opener at 
RIMAC Arena. This matchup with 
the Gauchos will be the team 's first 
tme test of how far it has come 
since last season. 

Hopefully its progress has 
been steadfast, beca use in the fol-
lowing weeks it will come up 
agai nst such scholarship-dangling 
powerhouses programs as CSU 
Long Beach, USC and Stanford, 
for which the Tritons will need to 
be at the height of their game to 
be successful and notch a few in 
the win column . 

The hard work and progres-
sion accomplished over the course 
of preseason practice and the 
added experience gained during 
last year's championship run will 
undoubtedly facilitate the Tritons' 
play this season. Coupled with the 
addition of the two big men, who 
will undoubtedly be integral in the 
team's success, and the on court 
maturation of the players returning 
from the D- Ill championship 
squad, the Blue and Gold should 
be able to realize their preseason 
goals. Head on over to our very 
own state of the art RIMAC arena 
on Saturday night at 7 p.m. to see it 
all 80 dewn.

No quarterback is ready for 
stardom after a year. John Elway

From my point of

could not make a 
worse choice than 
drafting V1ck, The fact that Vick will probably 

be in this draft , 
along with the fact that his 
prowess for escaping onrushing 
defensive players was displayed 
last year in the national champi-

Michael Vick 
is Not the 
Answer 

Reality 
Check 

BILL BURGER 

T he FL playoffs may be in high gear wi th two rounds yet to be fought, but for 
the San Diego Chargers and their 
fans, the season was mercifu lly put 
out of its misery a few weeks ago. 
After tying the league's record for 
futility in a 16-game season with a 
pitiful 1-15 record, the Chargers 
are obviously looking for answers. 

It seems as though I write a col-
umn about this time every year 
condemning the Chargers and 
their management for the decisions 
they made, but this year's column 
IS actually quite different. I think 
that this squad, which has fa nen 
fr.om AFC Champions to the 
league's doormat in no time flat, 
has aClllally made a few correct 
chOices, and with one more wise 
choice, may be on the way back up. 

First of all, the signing of John 
Butler as General Manager will 
only help matters. The guy is a 
proven winner. Butler's first move, 
the Signing of former Washington 
Rcdskins ' head coach ;\'orv Turner 
as offenslvt: coordinator, was also 
wise. With these two links in place, 
the Chargers go into the draft with 
a brain trust far mightier then they 
have had in previous years, But 
these two positive moves will all be 
for naught if they make a crucial 
mistake on draft day. 

A few days ago, The San Diego 
Unioll- Tribune ran a column on 
the front page of their sports sec-
tion pleading with Chargers' 
management to draft Virginia 
Tech quarterback Michael Vick 
with the number one pick. The 
article cited the tremendous 
upsides of Vick's game - his run 
threat, pure athl eticism and 
almost superna tural abi lity to 
avoid being sacked - as reasons 
fo r the choice being so important. 
From my point of view, the 
Chargers could not make a worse 
choice than drafting Vick. 

Assuming Vick leaves Virginia 
Tech early, and all indications are 
that he will, he will be a very hot 
comlilodity, and many teams will 

purs~I': the Chargers looking to 
trade into their No. 1 slot in the 
draft . I believe that the Chargers 
should take the best of these offers 
and t; '~de the rights to the No, 1 
pick tor as many high draft choices 
as po ' sible. They could then trade 
what :hq received for Vick to get 
even more, slightly lower, draft 

pick~. 
Why go for quanri ty over qual-

Ity'? S!lIlple. Even if Vick were 
Johnny Unltas' grandson or Joe 
Mo.rtana's illegitimate child, he 
stili would not be enough to turn 
the Chargers around. Football is a 
team sport and even with God's 
gift to foo tball out at qua rterback, 
the team would get shelled week 
in and week out without a good 
running back, linemen and wide 
receivers. The Chargers have none 
of these things. They need as 
many draft choices as possible to 
try to turn ~ round the mess that 
they have built over the las t four 
years.

PORTS 
She's Simply the Best 
Superstar Dostalek caps off an impressive career by garnering Player of Year 
By ISAAC PEARLMAN 
Staff Writer 

The ending to Cindy 
Dostalek's last game couldn't have 
been more appropriate if it had 
been scripted by the most senti-
mental Hollywood hack, With 15 
seconds left, fellow senior Christy 
Abizaid fed Dostalek the ball and 
she put it in the net to give the 
women's soccer team the victory 
and its first-ever Division If 
national championship. 

However, that wasn't the end of 
Dostalek's fairy tale. The Triton 
star was recently named CAA 
Division II 's Women's Soccer 
Player of the Year by the National 
Soccer Coaches Association of 
America and Adidas. 

"IThe award was I very, very 
unexpected," Dostalek said. "I did-
n't even expect to be AIl-
American. To be player of the year 
is pretty unbelievable: 

Her coach. Brian McMa nus, 
wasn't as surprised. 

"She really deserved it: 
McManus said, "She 's been a vir-
tual starter since freshman year 
and she gives a hundred percent 
every time she steps on the field . 
Seeing th\, two of them IDostalek 
and Abizaid, the only two seniors 
on the teaml after the goal was 
incredible, as was the look on their 
faces when they came off the 
field." 

For Dostalek, the long road 
began four years ago when she 
was recruited by McManus to play 
fo r UCSD. 

"She sent me a letter: 
McManus said, "And from her let-
ter I could see her desire: 

He began to recruit Dostalek 
after that, and she decided to come 
to San Diego - although not 
without some reservations. 

"I heard they were national 
champions and I was very intimat-
ed," Dostalek said. "I just wanted 
to play soccer because I liked the 
sport and it was fun : 

In fact, Dostalek wasn't even 
sure if she would make the team, 
so she set a furious pace on the 
field, one that hasn't slowed in 
four years. 

"Nothing is done at walking 
pace: McManus praised. 
"Everything is a hundred miles per 
hour and flat out: 

In his opinion, it is the amount

Volleyball to Face New Challenge 
Following Division III championship season, Tritons make the move to the next level 
By SCOTT BURROUGHS 
Staff Writer 

Returning from a Division III 
ational Championship season to 

discover that not only have you 
lost a few key players, but must 
also now wage wal' in the split 
Division I and II playoffs in post-
season play, would daunt even the 
most fearless of teams. Men 's vol-
leyball coach Ron Larsen and his 
troops, however, are ready to meet 
tQe ,challenge. 

"We're better now than we 
were at the end of last season, 
when we won the Division III 
championships and beat San 
Diego State: Larsen said, 
"Obviously we play in a very diffi-
cult league, with all the Division I 

scholarship schools like UCLA, 
USC and Stanford, but we are a 
good team and we are going to be 
able to compete: 

The Division III championship 
team of a year ago now has a com-
pletely different look to it. Gone 
are Ernie Young, last year's start-
ing middle; Matt Holve, who is 
abroad; and Ben Vernon, who 
chose to focus more on his acade-
mics, Replacing these players are 
two key recruits who will be 
impact players this coming season. 
Sophomore Brian Foot! will add 
height at 6 feet 6 inches tall, and 
hold down the middle, while 
Orange Coast College transfer 
student Griffin Cogomo, who also 
checks in at 6 feet 6 inches, will 
contribute as an outside hitter, 

These two players are looked 
upon by Larsen and his staff to be 
an integral part of the Triton 
attack. 

Returning stalwarts such as 
Zach Hite, Jordan Hove and 
Donald Chen will be asked to step 
their game up and take the team to 
the next level. Hite, in particular, 
looks to ratchet his game up a 
notch, 

"Zach was a very good player 
for us last year," Larsen said, 
" ow, entering his senior year, he 
looks even more determined and 
should contribute even more for 
us this year," 

Chris Mortimer is another 
player who will be crucial to the 
Thitons' success. 

"Last year Chris was a starter 

for us and performed well , but this 
year he has come back a lot 
stronger and wi!!"pI1!Y an increased 
role for us this season: Larsen 
commented. 

With the return of these sea-
soned veterans and the addition of 
new personnel, UCSD looks to be 
solid on the hardwood, Larsen 
feels that balanced play over the 
duration of the season will be inte-
gral to the team's success. 

"Our ability to compete in 
every match with a high level of 
intensity will be very important for 
us," he said, "At this level of play, 
we cannot afford a letdown at any 
time, because all of these teams are 
so good that they will make us pay
