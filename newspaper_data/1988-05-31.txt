Ban on Styrofoam possible 
By CHRIS HAMSON 
St.g Wrlt~r 

A resolution to limit the use of 
styrofoam dishes and containers 
on campus was submitted to the 
A.S. last Thursday. 

The resolution would elimi-
fta d!In1f stytofoam dishes 
and containers, with the excep-
tion of hot liquid containers, in 
all food services operated by the 
A.S ., as well as those food ser-
vices under the authority of the 
University Center Board. 

The A.S. resolution, submitted 
by Programming Commissioner, 
Jonathan Judaken also strongly 
recommends that UCSD Food 
Services cease using styrofoam 
dishes. UCSD Food Services is 
the largest on-campus user of 
styrofoam dishes and cups. 

The resolution was submitted 
under "opens" Thursday and will 
be considered by the A.S. next 
Wednesday. 

A similar resolution, unani-
mously enacted last Tuesday by 
the University Center Board, will 
prohibit the use of styrofoam 

dishes or containers in the new 
Price Center. 

Substitutes for styrofoam cost 
more. A UCSD Food Services 
study shows that alternate ma- . 
terials cost 71 percent more than 
styrofoam. According to the A.S. 
resolution, such costs would be 
passed on to the consumer. 

The resolutions came in re-
sponse to environmental con-
cerns raised by the UCSD re-
cycling co-op regarding the haz-
ards of productiolT and disposal 
of stryofoam (polystyrene foam). 

According to recycling co-op 
member Howard Reese, a major 
problem with the foam is that 
some of it is inflated with chloro-
flourocarbons, which break 
down the stratospheric ozone 
layer. 

Other problems stem from the 
non biodegradable nature of styro-
foam. "Styrofoam, although low 
in weight, takes up great volume 
in limited landfill space. It re-
mains floating in the rivers and 
the ocean and litters the parks," 
Reese said . 

"Styrofoam tends to dis-

integrate into little balls which 
birds and mammals sometimes 
eat. Wild animals are unable to 
break down the foam and can 
eventually die as a result ," he 
added. 

Styrofoam is made from petro-
leum, a~onrenewable resource 
while most replacements are 
made from paper, an easily 
recyclable renewable resource, 
according to Reese. 

"Protection of the environ-
ment is worth the added cost of 
styrofoam," Reese said . "Al-
though styrofoam is apparently 
cheaper, the direct cost does not 
include such things as increases 
in the rate of skin cancer due to 
depletion of the ozone, destruc-
tion of the aesthetic beauty of the 
earth through non biodegradable 
litter, and the long-range oppor-
tunity cost of using finite petro-
leum resources for one-time 
throw-away liquid containers." 

Similiar legislation has already 
been passed in the city of Ber-
keley and is under consideration 
in states such as Vermont.

President angered 
by council politics 
By JOHN SHAW 
rrllininl Director 

A.S . President Maynard 
Dimmesdale and Revelle student 
Bard-Alan Finlan have some-
thing in common. Both have 
slammed head on into a brick 
wall called politics. 

Finlan, who has spent the last 
10 months wading through a sea 
of bureaucratic red tape in a pri-
vacy rights dispute, was recently 
appointed to be the new student 
advocate by A.S. President 
Maynard Dimmesdale. 

Dimmesdale thought the A.S. 
council would overwhelmingly 
approve Finlan's appointment. 
After all, Dimmesdale reasoned, 
Finlan has first-hand knowledge 
of the complex campus grievance 
procedures, UC policies, and 
federal privacy rights regulations 

a student advocate must be 
familiar with to assist students 
who have complaints against the 
University. 

Almost singlehandedly, Finlan 
managed to force University 
officials to honor their own regu-
lations and provide him with the 
kind of grievance hearing he was 
entitled to, despite considerable 
resistance from Vice Chancellor 
Joseph Watson and Chancellor 
Richard Atkinson. 

At last Wednesday's /\.S . 
council meeting, Dimmesdale 
also experienced quite a bit of 
political maneuvering. When 
Dimmesdale formally announced 
Finlan as his appointment as 
student advocate, it became clear 
to the A.S. president that the 
council had been effectively 
organized to defeat his choice.

U C Irvine finds 
lobby group biased 
UCSA criticized for a prejUdice 
against southern U C campuses 

By ROBERT LEONE 
Stll/J W,iter 

UC Irvine's student govern-
ment will vote today on whether 
or not they will make their annual 
contribution to the University of 
California Student Association, 
a Sacramento-based lobbying 
organization for UC students. 

"In a nutshell, the student body 
assocation here at Irvine does 
not want the UCSA to represent 
them any longer," said ASUCI 
vice president for administrative 
services Jim Breslo. 

Breslo said that the main

complaint about the UCSA is 
that it caters to the northern UC 
campuses. UCl's proposed con-
tribution to UCSA is approxi-
mately S18,000 this year. 

UCSA director Jim Lofgren 
said, "It's a newly elected student 
government [at Irvine], and they 
don't know what we're about." 
According to Lofgren, the UCSA 
is working on a presentation for 
tonight'S ASUCI budget meet-
ing. Lofgren said that UCSA's 
role is to be the voice of students 
before the governor, legislature, 
and the Regents. 

ASUCSD vice president for 
external affairs Mordecai Potash 
and ASUCSD president May-
nard Dimmesdale will confer 
with the ASUCI on Thursday. 
"When we go up there to Irvine, 
we're not going up there to just 
get Irvine to back in," said 
Potash, who emphasized that 
the ASUCI did have legitimate 
concerns about UCSA. 

Potash said that in his opinion 
U CSA often seems to be oriented 
toward the northern UCs, in part 
because oftheir proximity to the 
UCSA's Sacramento offices . 
Potash said, however, that by 
demonstrating support for the 
UCSA the sourthern UCs can 
overcome this bias. 

UCSD itself has had problems 
with UCSA in the past, Potash 
said, "but most student leaders 
recognize how important and 
effective UCSA is." Potash aid 
thatifUCI eparate fromUCSA 
"it blow a big hole in UCSA' 
credibility," since UCSA i up-
posed to repre ent all UC stu-
dent . 

At the ASUC D budget meet-
ings la t week, a S17,420 con-
tribution for UCSA representa-
tion wa approved .

ADVOCATE: Dimmesdale angered by council 
CDntinued frDm page I 
amDunt of wDrk that was put in 
fDr Bard-Alan's defeat," 
Dimmesdale said . "Essentially, 
everYDne had a vDte before Bard-
Alan had a chance to. explain 
himself Dr pDint DUt his qualifi-
cations." 

During the public input periDd 
at the start Df the cDuncil meet-
ing, fDrmer A.S . President Dave 
Marchick attacked Finlan Dn 
persDnal grDunds and Dimmes-
dale Dn prDfessiDnal grounds. 

Marchick claimed that SDme 
peDple had tDld him that Finlan 
was "a difficult perSDn to deal 
with" and that Finlan has "legal 
prDblems with the University." 

Marchick also. attacked 
Dimmesdale's appDintment se-
lectiDn prDcess. He cDndemned 
Dimmesdale fDr not advertising 
the pDsitiDn of student advDcate 
to. the pUblic. 

"It shDuld nDt just be the peD-
pie in the A.S. that knDW abDut 
openings," Marchick said. 

Dimmesdale feels that Mar-
chick exerted his influence over 
the cDuncii and helped to sway 
their decisiDn nDt to approve 
Finlan's apPDintment. 

"[Marchick] did a IDt DfiDbby-
ing, but I'm nDt certain what his 
motives were. Certainly there 
were problems between Dave and 
Bard-Alan," Dimmesdale said. 

Marchick denies that he lDb-
bied fDr Finlan's defeat. 

When Marchick addressed the 
cDuncil Wednesday night, he said 
that Finlan had had cDnfro nta-
tiDns with several administratDrs 

and implied that they would be 
unable to. work with Finlan. 
Dimmesdale says that he specifi-
cally asked SDme of the adminis-
tratDrs who. wDuld be in contact 
with Finlan whether Dr nDt they 
would be able to. wDrk with him. 
Dimmesdale says they all replied 
that they did not forsee any 
problems wDrking with Finlan . 

"Dave is definitely trying to 
sway the cDuncil, but not with 
accurate infDrmation," Dimmes-
said. 

The cDuncil Dverwhemlingly 
decided to vote Finlan's appoint-
ment dDwn so that Dimmes-
dale cDuld open up the positiDn 
and attract more applicants 
tl)rough ad vertising. Dimmesdale 
agreed to advertise the pDsitiDn 
and expects to have an appoint-
ment ready fDr next week's 
cDuncil meeting. HDwever, 
Dimmesdale is doubtful that an 
applicant more qualified than 
Finlan will come along. 

"CDnstitutionally, Bard is 
qualified to be student advDcate," 
Dimmesdale said . "[The] per-
sDnnel [committee] recom-
mended Bard's passage." 

"The questiDn Df whether 
Bard-Alan was qualified was ' 
never addressed , just the prDcess 
of hDW he was appDinted," 
Dimmesdale added. 

Finlan feels the reaSDn why 
Marchick attacked him persDn-
ally is that Finlan was upset with 
Marchick and last year's student 
adVDcate for not giving him 
satisfactDry assistance in his fight 
with the University . 

"The very reaSDn why I'm 
running fDr the positiDn is be-
cause from my own experience I 
didn't see the office dDing the 
kind Df work that needed to be 
dDne. I also. didn't see anyone 
else apply fDr the pDsitiDn who. 
was willing to. do the wDrk," Fin-
Ian said . 

"I have no. prDblem with Dpen-
ing up the pDsitiDn to. other 
applicants as long as it is dDne 
formally and equally among the 
remainingappDintments," Finlan 
added. 

Besides the student advDcate 
pDsition, the only Dther ap-
pDintment that remains to be 
apprDved is the A.S. representa-
tive to the intramural spDrts and 
athletic complex planning and 
research cDmmittee . The spDrts 
cDmplex is a prDpDsed facility 
that wDuld hDuse a great variety 
Df athletic equipment and CDurts 
fDr student use . 

Dimmesdale appointed former 
A .S. presidential candidate 
JDhnny PattersDn to. the pDsi-
tiDn . Dimmesdale did nDt adver-
tise this pDsition, either. He 
pointed out that the A .S. consti-
tutiDn does nDt require the pre-
sident to. advertise J)T sDlicit 
applicatio ns for presidential 
apPDintments . 

"Going DUt and accepting 
applications is just a facade. It's 
nDt at all demDcratic," Dimmes-
dale said. 

Dimmesdale argues that the 
very nature Df an apPDintment 
precludes democracy. 

"I'm here to. make the best 
appDintment I can. Bard wasjust 

such an appDintment," Dimmes-
dale said . "That's the way the 
U.S . gDvernment is run . The 
President dDesn't go. DUt and 
advertise fDr his apPDintments. 
He uses his best judgment to. 
select the best peDple in their 
field ... 

At Wednesday's cDuncil meet-
ing, Finlan's apPDintment was 
vDted dDwn, but JDhnny Patter-

SDn's appDintment was PDst-
pDned . The cDuncil did nDt attack 
the appointment procedure 
Dimmesdale used to appDint 
PattersDn even thDugh it was 
identical to. the Dne he was criti-
cized for using fDr Finlan's ap-
pDintment. The cDuncil will vote 
on Patterson's apPDintment at

A.S. passes new budget 
CDntrDversy flared up Thursday as A.S . cDuncil members 

finished debating next year's A.S . budget , including added 
services and a 13 percent increase in funds allDcated fDr 
prDgramming. . 

FrDm the prDjected incDme Df $592,700, A.S. PreSIdent 
Maynard Dimmesdale had submitted a propDsed budget last 
week to. the finance cDmmittee, which included many changes 
and cuts frDm what individual DrganizatiDns and prDgrams had 
received in previDus years . 

In an interview MDnday, Dimmesdale said his budget wDuld 
prDbably receive much DPPDsitiDn, but that the CDuncil was 
gDing to. have to. SUpPDrt him because there was just not enDugh 
mDney to CDver the many new services. 

Since there wDuld be so. many cutbacks, Dimmesdale also. 
indicated that Drganizations would have to. find Dther means of 
incDme thrDugh soliciting spDnsorships and having mDre 
volunteers . 

A partIcular issue Dimmesdale said he felt WDuid receive 
much DPPDsitiDn was his prDpDsed student sa lary cuts. These 
included salary cuts fDr A.S. Dfficers, as well as the staff of A.S . 
services. He said that he felt the A.S. needed to. get away with 
lDwer student salaries and lower administrative salaries. 

Dimmesdale said that the propDsed allDcatiDn fDr student 
and administrative salaries, totalling almDst Dne-fifth Df the 
Dverall budget was "Dne Df the biggest things that I think is 
outrageDus," and that the DpiniDn Df the cDuncil was that , "I 
have ' hacked' student salaries."

Sandbox Politics 
Johnny Patterson and Maynard DimmesdaJe, 

running for president earlier this quarter, provided 
the UCSD electorate with a clear choice - non-
confmntationaJ quietism or dissatisfied activism . 

The unknown candidate, activist Dimmesdale, 
won. Won big . He got 63 percent ; more than 
Reagan against Mondale. 

There was a message for the A .S. in Dimmesdale's 
election. Students don't want the same old bullshit 
from the A .S. - we want a government willing to 
stand up for itself and us . 

However, shortly after Dimmesdale was elected 
with an A .S . Council made up mostly of Patterson 
supporters, we heard talk of an organized effort not 
to cooperate with his administration. In the wake of 
his proposals to cut padded A .S. salaries in favor of 
programs to benefit the student body, we heard the 
word "i mpeachment." 

Now, Dimmesdale is having problems getting a 
perfectly qualified appointee approved by the A .S . 
Council. 

It all started when Dimmesdale took a look at 
Patterson, defeated VP External Affairs candidate 
Vaughn Rex, and Bard-Alan Finlan, the student 
with the lengthy privacy struggle with the admini-
stration. He wanted to find places for these three 
intelligent , dedicated people. 

Dimmesdale named Patterson to an athletics 
commission appointment concerned with new 
campus facilities, and Rex as the UC Student Asso-
ciation representative . He appointed Patterson 
without opening the position to the nominating 
process and both sparked no opposition from the 
Council. 

He tried to do the same with Finlan as a student 
legal advocate. Finlan is well qualified for the post 
- he clearly knows more about challengingadmini-
strative structures than anyone on campus, admini-
strators included. 

But he's not part ofthe same old same old. After a 
specious challenge to Finlan because , opponents 
said, the position was not open to a nominating 
process, Finlan (and, perhaps more to the point for 
the A.S . Council , Dimmesdale) lost , 15-2. 

It's the hazard of having an outsider president and 
an insider council. And it's the hazard of having a 
council still stuck in a sandbox. After checking the 
election results , and checking again to see whether 
Finlan's experience could benefit students - which 
it could - the A.S. Council should reconsider it's 
Finlan vote and reconsider its attitude toward 
student politics . 

A Letter Home 
Our former Features Editor, Kristen McCleary, is 

s pending the quarter in Mexico City. She wrote last 
week about being an American abroad: 

"I think my program is a Comm student's dream 
(tactless , but true) . We're studyi ng Marxism, all 
sorts of radical political theories and finding out 
exactly what sort of big, bad country the U .S. is . For 
example, we dump radioactive wastes near Indian 
commun ities, and open asbestos factories here 
si nce we can't do it in our own country, etc . . . 
[Asbestos is one of the most carcinogenic substances 
extant ; it is mostly banned here in the United 
States.] 

"Not that I didn't know these things before, but 
now our noses are getting rubbed into the mess our 
country has made. Not easy being the world's most 
powerful country! Our program [UC Study Abroad] 
is ending with a trip to Cuba to complete the reform 
of our capitalist tendencies . 

"I don't mean to sound sarcastic, because what 
we're learning is interesting and terribly true, but it's 
just that one can get t ired of being held accountable 
for Reagan's policies. I think some of the people 
here think that he actually calls us up to ask our 
opinion on whether he should send troops to 
Panama ... ..

Anti-gay Humor 
Not Festive 
Editor: 

In my humble opinion, it's safe to 
describe the social scene here at 
UCSD as less than a sensationally 
wild experience, .but I do think that 
the Sun God Festival has the poten-
tial to be a popular, highly festive 
event which could attract a large, 
diverse crowd of students . 

That's why I was surprised, dis-
appointed, and angered that the 
Festival could feature a comedian 
like Pauly Shore, who was so bla-
tantly sexist , anti-homosexual and 
unamusing that I found myself 
watching his act in disbelief that my 
student fees were being used to pay 
such tactless , narrow-minded "enter-
tainer. " 

Why can't the entertainment on 
our campus be a reflection of the 
broad-based, innovative, socially 
conscious kinds of thinking that go 
on here? There is enough intelligent, 
creative humor out there that an 
A.S.-sponsored event could feature 
a classier act. 

Laura Saponara 

Need Taxes? 
That's Prop 'A' 
Editor: 

Here we go again . It seems that 
the politicians are never satisfied . 
With Proposition A, the voters of 

San Diego County are being asked 
to approve yet another sales tax 
increase. 

Already, San Diego County suf-
fers from one of the highest sales tax 
rates in California - we are in the 
top fifteen percent! But that's not 
enough for the politicians; now, we 
are being asked to meekly accept an 
increase which would force us to pay 
the highest sales tax in the State of 
California . 

Of all the 58 counties in California, 
only free-spending Alameda and 
Santa Clara are saddled with such a 
high sales tax; why should San Diego 
be given the dubious distinction of 
becoming the third county to enact a 
seven percent sales tax? Is our local 
government so wasteful that we must 
be taxed more than other Califor-
nians? 

Enough! The special interest poli-
ticians don't need any more of our 
money; we are already taxed enough. 
If they don't know how to run the 
cou nty on what they have, then they 
should start learning how right now! 
We should not reward managerial 
incompetence with another tax 
increase.

Crew Team 
Unstroked 
Editor: 

Beginning in early October, 1987 
the UCSD men's and women's crews 
began working out for the 1988 
season. Of the almost two hundred 
people who started in October, more 
than eighty actively competed during 

the racing season , 
Participation on the crew team 

meant getting up early in the morn-
ing, six or seven days a week, rain or 
shine, to prepare ourselves for events 
such as the San Diego Crew Classic, 
Southwest Regionals, Pacific Coast 
Championships, and myraid "one 
on one" races against schools from 
across the state. 

On the third weekend of this 
month the entire men's and women's 
crews travelled to Sacramento to 
participate in the Pacific Coast 
Championships. Crews rowed in 
IOO-degree weather and generally 
performed well , particulary the 
novice crews. 

If this is the first that you have 
heard about UCSD crew, that would 
not be in the least bit suprising. This 
may be, in part, due to poor public 
relations on our part. We have taken 
steps to remedy this . However, we 
would like to point out the poor 
quality of coverage we have received 
through the entire season from the 
Guardian. The articles that have 
been written about crew at UCSD 
have been few and far between. 
Those that were written were either 
negative or, at best neutral. 

Several overtures were made to-
wards the Sports Editor to encour-
age him to take notice of the team. 
This resulted in one or two paltry 
announcements of race results and 
little else. One particularly disgrace-
ful example was the printing of a 
photograph taken at last year's Crew 
Classic which was of another team! 

To further stimulate the Sports 
Editor's interest, we invited him, or

Nuclear Missiles Stamped 'Made by UC' 
Editor: 
Did you know that every nuclear weapon 
in the u.s. arsenal has the University of 
California's seal on it? Each nuclear 
weapon in the arsenal has been conceived, 
designed, engineered, and maintained at 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New 
Mexico, and the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory, east of San Fran-
cisco. 

These laboratories are, in turn, managed 
by the University of California for the U.S. 
Department of Energy for a retainer that 
amounts to little more than one-quQTler 0/ 
one percent of the U.c. total annual 
budget. 

The role of the University in managing 
the weapons laboratories has often been 
controversial. Recent controversies have 
dealt with the need for nuclear testing, the 
effectiveness of U.c. management, and 
disputes over the X-ray laser program. The 
mission of the laboralories and their rela-

tionship to the University are especially 
important in the current situation of intense 
negotiations with the Soviet Union over 
major cuts in nuclear weapons (the Stra-
tegic Arms Reduction Talks), limits on 
nuclear testing, and defense in space. 

At various times faculty and student 
groups have protested University involve-
ment, particularly when the management 
contract comes up for renewal. Some argue 
that the University is contributing to the 
arms race and that holding the contract is 
not a proper public service activity for an 
institute of higher education. 

Conversely, others argue that there are 
benefits to U.C. management of the labs 
such as the fostering of an atmosphere 
which allows laboratory scientists to speak 
out on issues, at times taking positions 
critical of those taken by the U.S . govern-
ment, or by the University and laboratory

OPINION 

Q AND A 
Would you pay 5 or 6¢ extra for a drink on campus if they were to use 
recyclable cups? 

Ifeellhat students don 'I have a 
choice. If the administralion 
really wants 10 change it the 
students are slill going 10 be 
Ihirslyand will slill buy Ihe drink.

the Sports Editor that, if we 
provided photographs, an article 
might be written to go along with 
them or the race results pub-
lished . The film was provided on 
the day after the event. 

The May 26 issue of the 
Guardian made no mention what-
soever of the regatta. Instead of 
covering the event, the Guardian 
published an article about the 

. L.A. Lakers. The Lakers are not 
a UCSD team and, furthermore , 

Yes, I would. II seems like a lot

if we wished to read an authorita-
tive article about the Lakers we 
would read it in the L. A. Times. 

This lack of interest demon-
strated by the Guardian is sur-
prising, and disappointing con-
sidering the huge number of 
people who have been touched 
by the sport this year and in 
years past. It should also be 
noted that rowing was the first 
organized intercollegiate sport 
at UCSD and that the team's

One final note. The men's 
novice heavyweight made it to 
the Grand t' mal at the t'acillc 
Coast Championships, only the 
second men's team to do so in the 
history of the team. The mens' 
novice lightweight crew won the 
petite final, beating Cal for the 
second time in two days (the only 
two times in the team's history). 
These results bode well for next 

year's varsity crew. We certainly 
hope that we will receive the 
equitable news coverage we have 
earned.

Academic Senate meeting 
Fifth College requirements, 
master campus plan reviewed 

By ERIC CHAZANKIN 
St~ Writ~, 

The UCSD Academic Senate rejected a report 
containing proposed general education require-
ments for Fifth College after professors questi-
oned what they saw as a lack of requirements in 
the hard sciences. 

The Senate also heard a report on the new 
master plan for the University at its meeting last 
Tuesday. 

The committee report on the Fifth College 
requirements was intended to set the long-term 
University policy in this area. 

After debate, the report was rejected by the 
Academic Senate by a vote of 37-28 . This will not 
directly affect incoming Fifth College students 
since their requirements are already set, but it does 
leave the college without a long-term breadth 
requirement policy. 

working with a San Francisco design firm on the 
plan. " We see UCSD as a place which has the full 
range of environmental opportunities," he con-
tinued , as he showed slides of scenes around 
UCSD. 

Major features of the new plan include the con-
cept of "neighborhoods" within UCSD, apart 
from the different colleges. These would be separ-
ated by areas of open space, including manyeuca-
Iyptus trees. "The eucalyptus groves ... are sensi-
tive to new development," said John Kriken , a 
partner in the San Francisco design firm of Skid-
more, Owings, '" Merrill . 

Another long-term goal of the plan was to 
establish a "peripheral" road system, with parking 
areas reached by " finger" roads from a main loop 
around UCSD, "so traffic is not pulled through 
the campus," continued Kriken. Parking struc-
tures were mentioned as a possible component of 
this plan. 

Academic Senate members generally ex.pressed 
approval for the new plan, but dissatisfaction with 
the present campus environment, which some saw 
as haphazard. Kriken agreed that "with rapid 
expansion, many land-use opportunities are

management. LANL and LLNL 
are totally funded by the U.S. 
government with UC lending 
little more than its prestigious 
name to the activites that are 
conducted at these weapons 
labs . 

The University has ample 
opportunity through its manage-
ment position to take a greater 
role in the decision-making that 
goes on at the labs, but it has not 
and does not choose to do so. 
Faculty interest in the nature of 
the relationship has led to the 
establishment of a systemwide 
Academic Senate Committee 
charged with educating the fa-
culty on University-laboratory 
issues in anticipation of the next 
contract renewal cycle, which 
will begin in 1990. 

UC has managed these labs 

since Los Alamos' inception in 
1943, and Livermore's in 1953 , 
and the way the Regents have 
been voting when the contract 
has some up for renewal , UC will 
continue to do so for decades to 
come. If, however, the Regents 
decide to terminate the contract , 
the labs will not wither up and 
die, ending the U.S. side of the 
arms race. They will continue to 
function under the management 
of the Department of Energy or 
a large corporation, such as 
Martin Marietta which already 
runs the Oak Ridge Laboratory 
in Tennessee. The University 
should decide to either take a 
stronger management role or 
drop the contract altogether. 

Why, then, does the University 
continue to oversee the labs if it 
does not exercise any input into 
the decision-making processes at 
them? Proponents argue that the 
management position falls under 
the area of Public Service in the

argue that, by continuing to 
advocate the arms race , the 
University is performing a public 
disservice. The relationship be-
tween the weapons labs and the

a betrayal of the appropriate role 
of the University as an institute 
of higher education . 

The University of California is 
one of the most respected uni-

sleep, then look up "hypnosis" in 
your encyclopedia . There you 
will find that in 1840 James 
Braid , who invented the word 
"hypnotism," demonstrated his 
theory of hypnosis by putting his 
subjects into a trance by the use 
of measures that tired the eyes. 

Commands given to a person 
while in this somnambulistic 
state will be carried out even 
after the subject is fully awake. 
The subject may be made to do 
things ordinarily beyond him, if 
intense concentration of atten-
tion is an important factor in the 
performance. 

Destructive religious cults 
brin, about this hypnotic state 
by inducing fatigue in their 
members through constant activ-
ity, fasting, and deprivation of 
sleep. 

The San Diego Church of 
Christ has the practice of kicking 

off a special contribution drive 
with a three-day fast, ending 
with an all night prayer meeting. 
Suggestions are made that God 
pours out blessing to those who 
give liberally and keeps bad 
things from happening to them. 
It is suggested that not giving 
sacrificially rules out salvation 
for them. 

A May 24 , 1987 bulletin ofthe 
church states that the special 
contribution on that day was 
5346,086 and the attendance was 
961. Of that number, 164 were 
guests. Some were children. One 
young man, whose marriage was 
later broken up by the church, 
told me that he gave $3,000 on 
that day. 

The special contributions are 
over and above the weekly contri-
butions, which have reached 
524,000.

Learning to be upwardly mobile 

UCSD Flying Club has high hopes 
By TINA CORREIA 
G".,di_ h,tt,,, 

Flying in a small aircraft high 
above La Jolla , the pilot bails 
out, and you're left alone in the 
plane. What would you do? 

Members of the UCSO Flying 
Club can learn what to do in a 
si tuation such as this, as well as 
other aspects of aviation. 

"The Flying Club began in the 
fall of 1987 with the philosophy 
of getting people interested in 
aviation, learning how to fly, 
and getting them discounted 
rates," club president Laurence 
Balter said. 

The idea behind forming the 
Flying Club originated last 
summer with Balter and his friend 
Greg Stein, now club vice presi-
dent. As an incoming freshman, 
Balter was torn between attend-
ing a university with an aviation 
program or attending UCSO. 
Balter and Stein brainstormed 
and decided to create a flying 
club here. 

"I thought , 'why not try to 
help someone who is interested 
in the field?," Balter said. 

The club has grown to include 
about 100 members, 60 of whom 
are active and learning how to 
fl y. The other members are 
interested in aviation but either 
do not have the time or the 
money to pursue flying. A few 
active members are already pilots. 
There are no pre-requisites for 
joining the club and a member 
does not have to be a UCSD 

actually flying." 
The simulator usuaUy costs 

S570 per hour, but they used the 
si mulator for free. 

In February, Balter initiated 
the private pilot ground school. 
The objective of the school was 
to make learning to fly less costly 
by limiting expenses. 

Ground school is a 14-week 
course which meets twice a week 
(and has an optional section) 
and covers topics including: the 
principles of flight , navigation, 
weather, radio commuOication, 
and FAA regulations. The chief 
instructor, John Tucker, is a 
retired chief pilot of Air Cal and 
PSA, and has fiftY)'ears of expe-
rience in aviation. 

The ground school has several 
instructional aids , such as FAA 
pamphlets, a supplemental video, 
and a slide-rule flight computer. 

T he club is planning to pro-
pose a grant for a flight simula-
tor. They hope to someday get 
airplanes on a lease-back agree-
ment. 

"We would like to establish a 
name for ourselves in the rest of 
the country by providing high-
quality training," Balter said . 

A final exam ends ground 
school instruction. If student s 
pass with a score of75 percent or 
above, they are signed off to take 
the FAA written exam. If they 
pass this , they receive a two-year 
certificate with which they must 
com plete flight training. 

Currently the Flying Club is 
contracting out flight t raining 

Freshman Laurence Balter. president of the Flying Club. says the 
club " is sparking interest across the counlry." 

student. 
The Flying Club also has 

scheduled guest s peakers from 
the military, goverment, and the 
airlines. The club went on a trip 
to Miramar to visit the Air Traf-
fic Control Radar Room and the 
Top Gun School. It also held a 
raffle among members to choose 
10 people to fly the U.S. Air 
BAE-146 flight simulator. 

"I\'s a lot of fun [the flight 
imuJatorJ," Balter said ."lt 's like 

for students through Chrysler 
Aviation, North American Air-
line Training Group, and San 
Diego-based Western Aviation 
and Palomar- based Flight Inter-
nat ional. 

The first part of flight training 
is 10 to 15 hours of actual flying 
with an instructor. The instruc-
tor can then sign the student off 
to fl y solo. The next step is 
twenty hour of cross-country 

training with an instructor dur-
ing which the student nies 50-
mile di~tances . 

Finally, the student flies a 
check-ride with an examiner 
designated by the FAA. 

"It's similar to a driver's license 
test," Balter said. If the students 
successfully complete the in-flight 
exam they receive a private pilot's 
license . 

Members of the Flying Club 
have been petitioning on campus 
to get an accredited aeronautical 

program established. They ha ve 
collected over 500 signatures. 

"The problem is that UCSD is 
such a research-oriented school. 
We want to provide a broad 
science of ed ucation," Balter said. 

In addition, Professor James 
Arnold is working on starting a 
space, science, and engineering 
curriculum. 

" Hopefully we will be able to 
merge the aeronautical program 
with the space, science and engi-
neering program, or work to-
gether. There are similarities 
between the two," Balter said. 

"The chool is growing so 
much and the popularity of the 
club and outside interest in it is 
sparking interest aero s the 
country," Balter said. He has 
received letters from student 
across the nation expre si ng a 
desire for an education here in 
aviation training. 

The Flying Club is hoping to 
start the aeronautical program 
for academic credit in fall quar-
ter and condense ground school 
to a ten-week program. If a deci-
ion is made in favor of the pro-

gram, it will be implemented 
over the summer and ready for 
students in the fall. 

"The more we wait, the less 
chance it will happen. Vie would 
like to start with a minor pro-
gram and then possibly create a 
major program," Balter said . 
Balter al 0 di cu ed orne ad-
va nces he hopes the club will 
make in the near fu t.ure. 

"Mesa College may come in 
and teach an aviation program 
imilar to the one they have. We 

could use existing departments 
and faculty with a small amount 
of investment in setting it up. It 
would be taught like Subject A is 
taught here," Balter said. 

"We would like to take some-
one from zero time to an almost 
airline-proficient level," Balter 
said. Thcre is a hiring trend in 
the airlines which began last year 
and is expected to continue 
through 1997 and beyond. It is 
predicted that 50,000 pilots will 
be hired by then. 

"There are three reasons for 
this: airline deregulation, man-
datory retirement at age 60, and 
the military keeping their pilots 
for a longer period oftime," BaI-
ter said. 

The Flying Club wants to help 
students capitalize on this hiring 
trend . Some airlines have an ad 
initio in which an airline subsid-
izes students' training during their 
freshman year. Eventually, the 
st udents will be offered a job 

~ ~ , ,,10: w~ Ol'l ~ '> 
...,ho v\{' til ' ..... e 

with that particular airline. 
"The reason for this is a lack of 

experience. A large percentage 
of accidents are pilot error. The 
airlines would like to bring expe-
rience levels up in a shorter period 
of time," Balter said. 

For now, the Flying Club has 
flight experience of a different 
kind planned. One June 4 it will 
hold an air race road rally. All 
pilots and crew will be handed an 
envelope instructing them to fly 
to a certain airport . During the 

rally they will have to pick up 
certain items or answer questions 
in order to collect points. There 
are ten planes on reserve. The 
crews will have to do the paper-
work, navigation , and actual fly-
ing to the designated airports . A 
road rally, with a party follow-
ing, will end the race. 

For more information about 
the Flying Club, meetings are 
held at 7 p.m. Wednesdays in 
Peterson Hall , Room 103.

type of people work at KSDT. 
the Of/-campus radio stalion? 
Slaff writer Autumn Ehrmann 
interviewed one K S D T disc 
jockey. Matthew Schnurer. and 
this is what s.he learned. 

G: Can yo u give me a brief des-
cription of what KSDT is all 
about? 
M.S.: It's a co-op, which mea ns 
it's a non-profit organization. 
It's run and operated by UCSD 
st udents. We provide alternative 
music to the listening commun-
ity - anyone who wants to listen 
to something different. 
G: What's the difference between 
KSDT and a for-profit radio 
station? 
M.S.: We don 't have commer-
cials; we have PSAs, which are 
Public Service Announcements. 
They don't pay us and we pay no 
one. 
G: What kinds of PSA's do you 
have? 
M .S.: We run announcements 
for things like the International 
Film Series, Goodwill, the Fores-
try Service. If it helps the com-
munity, we'll put it on. 
G: If you don't take money for 
your announcements , how are 
you funded? 
M.S.: We get some money from 
the AS. Other money comes from 
dues . Each member of the radio 
station pays S5 per quarter. 
G: What prompted you to join 
KSDT? 
M.S.: Typically, when I join 

things, it's because of a girl. This 
girl was in my chemistry class 
and also worked for the radio 
station. What pushed me over 
the edge, however, wasthat 1 saw 
yet another cute girl hanging 
around the station. I was inter-
ested in the station, of course. 
The girls just acted as ca talysts 
for me to actually join. 
G: When did you start working 
at the station? 
M.S.: Two years ago . It was 
spring quarter of my freshman 
year. 
G: So how did you finally join 
KSOT? 
M.S.: Well , basically they said, 
' Do a demo tape,' so T said 'OK '. 
G: So how did you do in the 

Studio? 
M.S.: Woll, I did the tape and 
they told me to pick out a 
department that I thought would 
be nice. 
G: What departments did you 
have to choose from? 
M.S.: Well, there's Music, Pub-
lic Affairs, Publicity and Promo-
tion, Production, and News and 
Sports. 
G: Which one did you pick? 
M.S.: I picked Publicity and 
Promotion. What I deal with arc 
giveaways , publicity about 
KSOT, deals outside the radio 
station and public affairs . It 's 
pretty tangled . 
G: Are you still in that de-
partment?

M.S.: Somewhat. Now I'ma OJ. 
Typically, most people want to 
be a OJ when they join. That's 
why they do the initial demo 
tape. I'd say 60 to 75 percent of 
the people who join KSDT are 
doing it to be a OJ or a sports 
broadcaster or newscaster. Some-
thing along th.ose lines. 
G: How many records do you

M.S.: That's like when people 
ask me, ' How many comic books 
do you have, Mati?' I don't really 
know. A lot. Some records we 
don't have though, like the Debby 
Gibson album.

G: What are your favorite 
records? 
M.S.: I knew this was going to 
come up, so I thought of a list: 
Sisters of Mercy, Ozzy Osborne,

queen I really liked - Tiffany (J 
make fun of her but I can listen 
to her songs), Midnight Oil and 
Killing Joke. ' 
G: That's a pretty diverse se-
lection. 
M.S.: My tastes go all over the 
place, sort of like my saliva. 
G: Do you think that KSDT has 
helped you meet more girls? 
M.S.: Well, not really. 
G: Maybe we can print your 
home phone number so any 
interested girls can call you. 
M.S.: No, I don't think so. 
G: What's your idea of a perfect

UCSD's Vallez wins 800-meter 
race at track nationals 
Becomes first Triton to earn All-American status in track 

By JONATHAN SCHRETER 
Sports Editor 

Tim Vallez became the first 
runner from UC San Diego to be 
named an All-American for track 
after he finished first in the 800-
meter run at the NCAA National 
Track Tournament last weekend . 

Vallez, a graduating senior this 
year, finished the race in a blis-
tering 1:51.86, almost half a 
second slower than his qualify-
ing time of I:S1.48 (the UCSD 
record) which had him seeded 
second in the race. The first place 
finish is also the first time a 
Triton has won a track event at 
Nationals. 

Player Profile 

Shannon Quigley finished 
sixth for UCSD in the shotput 
with a shot of 43' /.7S" . Quigley 
also qualified for the discus throw 
but did not make it past the pre-
liminary round. 

Gisele English, the last Triton 
runner to qualify for Nationals, 
finished 11 th in the I,SOO-meter 
prelims and was not eligible to 
advance to the finals . 

The Tritons' top runner of the 
year , Denise McFayden, pulled 
out of the I,SOO-meter prelims 
because of an injury that has 
kept her out of training for the 
past two weeks. 

"She pulled a muscle in her hip 

and hasn't been able to run. With 
a bout ISO meters to go, she just 
ran out of gas," UCSD Head 
Coach Mark Stanforth said . 

McFayden also qualified for 
the 3,OOO-meter race but did not 
enter because of her injury. 

"As it turns out, the 3,000-
meter prelims were the 3,000-
meter finals and they were run 
on Saturday. She could have 
gotten three more days of rest 
had she entered the 3,OOO-meter 
race and dropped the I,SOO," 
Stanforth said . 

Rick Harper qualified for the 
Tritons in the pole vault but 
could not make the starting

to play in local tournaments. 
"My family has been such a 

great support to me. Tennis is 
what our family has in com-
mon," Behrens said . Once you 
get to know her it is obvious 
what an important part of her 
life her family is. 

and then and still do well," 
Behrens said. He will attend 
UCLA on a tennis scholar-
ship next year. 

Behrens said, "If he goes 
pro, 111 use my economics 
degree from UCSD to be his 
manager." 

height of 14'5". 
"There was a gusty crosswind 

that could have affected a lot of 
the vaulters' performance," 
Stanforth said. Only six out of 
an initial26 vaulters were able to 
make the 15'1" mark that quali-
fied them for the finals. 

With the season now officially 
concluded, Stanforth can look 
ahead to next year's season 
knowing the majority of his team 
will be returning (including the 
three women who qualified for 
Nationals). That, combined with 
a strong recruiting season, could 
vault the Tritons to the top ofthe 
NCAA next year. 

Denise McFayden could not fin-
ish her 1 ,SOD-meter race. 

W hat could be more fun for a 21 year-old college student 
than spending the summer 
touring the nation, kicking 
back in hotel rooms and mak-
ing lots of new friends , all 
paid for and completely sup-
ported by Dad and Mom? 
Add a few tennis matches and 
you have a complete descrip-
tion of the summers of Chris-
tine Behrens. 

When she returned from 
Nationals this year she told all 
her friends: "My dad flew to 
Georgia to watch me play. I 
remember hearing him yell 
'Christine' just when I needed 
the strength to go on and win 
the semi-finals." 

But for the older Behrens, 
UCSD was th~ place to go to 
school. "Sure, I got offers 
from Division I schools for 
tennis scholarships. Columbia 
[in New York] really tried to 
recruit me and I almost went 
there, but I wanted to go 
somewhere that I could get in, 
that was close to home, had a 
decent team and was really 
good academically. Once I 
thought about it, UCSD was 
the place for me." 

Christine Behrens has been ranked the No. 1 women's tennis 
player for the past two years. 

Behrens is the No. I singles 
player on UCSD's women's 
tennis team. Just two weeks 
ago she placed second at the 
National Division III tour-
nament in Georgia. That's a 
step up from last year when 
she placed third in the nation 
as a freshman. Since Behrens 
is just a sophomore this year 
she'l have two more years to 
reach that elusive No. I spot. 

Behrens started taking ten-
nis lessons when she was siJ( 
years old on the urging of her 
parents. She "kind of like it," 
she said, but when she was 
nine, tennis became a much 
more serious part of her life. It 
was at that age that she began 

Both of her parents play 
tennis, but right now the fami-
ly 's focus is on Behrens' 
younger brother Bill. On the 
wall next to her bed, Behrens 
has cut out the large article on 
her little brother that appeared 
in the Los Angeles Times. He 
is ranked No.1 in the l6-year-
old and under division in 
Southern California. He re-
cently won the Ojai Tourna-
ment, a prestigious event for 
young amateurs. 

"Bill started playing around 
the same age that I did, but he 
never had to work at it as hard 
as I did. I had to devote a lot 
of time to be the best where he 
could skip a few practices now 

Behrens concentrated on 
getting good grades at Rolling 
Hills High School in Palos 
Verdes, where her family lives 
now. She played all four years 
on the girls' varsity tennis 
team and did well. She was 
Most Valuable Player and won 
the Bay League Champion-
ships in doubles her freshman 
and sophomore years, and 
won the league in singles her 
junior and senior years. That 
would be enough for any col-

lege team to start looking 
seriously at her. 

Behrens is really glad that 
she chose UCSD. "I love the 
girls on the team. We have 
such a great time together. 
Going to Nationals was a 
blast! Laze [Liz LaPlante, the 
tennis team's head coach] is 
great, too. Playing on a team is 
definitely better than playing 
individually in the summer. 
Your friends you travel with 
all support you, but you still 
play against them sometimes. 
On a team you know that 
everyone is making a com-
bined effort to win even 
though you are playing in-

dividually ... 
Behrens does not look into 

the future and see herself play-
ing pro, but it is a possibility. 
Instead of playing the ama-
teur circuits this summer, she 
may try tite $10,000 circuit, a 
satellite pro tournament, the 
lowest level of professional 
tournament. "Why not? I 
might as well see how I can 
do," Behrens said. 

Playing on the professional 
circuit could involve drug 
testing. This year at Nationals, 
Behrens was tested for drugs 
for the first time right before 
the finals match .

Cycling team finishes eighth at Nationals 
UCSD's Mark Wineman's first 

place finish in the National 
Criterium Championship helped 
the Triton cycling team clinch 
eighth place at Nationals held 
May 21-22 at Cal Poly San Luis 
Obi po. 

Competing against the top 36 
teams of the nation, including 
Division I schools such as Prince-
ton, Penn State, Stanford and 
the Univer ity of Colorado, the 
eighth-place finish is one of the 
cycling club's be t in years. 

The national event con istcd 

of four races: the IOO-kilometer 
road race, the 16-kilometer team 
time trial and two criteriums 
totalling 67 kilometers. 

Rough going in the early race 
made it all the more difficult for 
the'team to finish as high as they 
did . lOS-degree heat took its toll 
on the men' squad with the only 
highlight of the hilly circuit being 
points earned by Andy Nevitt's 
finish for King of the Mountain . 

The women's squad , however, 
handled the heat , with Cri ti 
Wellington finishing 14th, indy 
Brown 19th, and Sherrie Mcln-

tosh coming in 26th . After the 
first day of competition, the 
Tritons were in 18th place. 

Sunday's team time trial gave 
the team a new opportunity to 
improve their standings. 
- Larry Fiorentino, Nevitt, 
Michael Robertson, Dave War-
ren and Wineman combined to 
form the men's team. Their out-
look was weak from the start 
when Warren's foot lipped from 
the pedal, causing a momentary 
lapse in formation , 10 ing pre-
cious second . After regrouping, 
the team managed to maneuver 

through the technical portion of 
the course, only to lose Wine-
man to a dangerous tire blowout. 

With the loss of Wineman, the 
team had to work even harder. 
Their determination paid off with 
one ofthe fastest eight kilometer 
splits of the day. Unfortunately, 
after the strong run and because 
of the trenuous road race the 
day before, Fiorentino pulled 
out, leaving three Triton riders 
to finish the race. 

Even with the setbacks, UCSD 
fini hed in a respectable 18th 
po ition. The women' team, with 

Brown, Mcintosh and Welling-
ton, finished in an even more 
impressive seventh pll\ce to keep 
the Tritons in the running for a 
top-10 finish . 

The team qualified for a spot 
in the criterium finals when 
Wineman and Nevitt captured 
eventh and eighth places respec-

tively. With newfound energy, 
the men's team dominated with 
criteriums, with Wineman tak-
ing first and Nevitt finishing ixth 
to lead the Tritons to eighth place 
overall.
