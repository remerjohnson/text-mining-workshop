# Text Mining Workshop Materials

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks around courses teaching text mining, using the UCSD Guardian student newspaper as a corpus. The original course material is captured in the Jupyter notebook `ucsd_newspapers.ipynb`, while the new material will be located in the notebook `text_mining_workshop.ipynb`. 

Enjoy!
